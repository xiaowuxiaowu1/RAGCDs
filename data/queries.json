On the one hand, according to the previous nucleation mechanism [61], the nucleation effect of CDs can be ascribed to the fact that the hydration products preferentially attach to CDs surface [30], since the nucleation energy on CDs surface is smaller than that in pore solution of cement. This facilitates the crystallization of hydrates. Therefore, CDs can significantly accelerate the hydration of cement. On the other hand, CDs with larger sizes possess a smaller quantity of particles under\n\nthe same dosage, consequently causing a decrease of nucleation sites.",

Extensive work has revealed the intuitive impact of the heteroatom effect on the adsorption performance of covalent organic framework (COF) adsorbents for non-polar gases. However, more influencing factors must be studied to more precisely design and construct target-specific COF adsorbents. In this work, an underlying influencing factor, local polarity, is discovered, which is defined as the polarity of the functional moiety. Due to the substitution of strong electrophile, the electron cloud distribution of the COF framework is regulated, and the local polarity that better matches the adsorption of target electrophilic gas (iodine) has been observed.",

However, for the precise construction of target-specific COFs, more influencing factors need to be identified.\n\nIn this work, we proposed an ionic liquid solution process (ILSP) strategy to post-modify the neutral covalent organic framework TpPaSO$_{3}$H (COF-H) to improve its iodine capture performance (Fig. 1).",

Electrochemical characterizations are considered an effective method to identify the catalyst-mediated electron transfer pathway [72]. The chronoamperometry (i-t) curve was utilized to identify the presence of the electron transfer pathway in the system (Fig. 6d). It is observed that upon the addition of PMS, there was a significant negative current in the system, indicating the formation of a complex between the catalyst and PMS.

A monomer suitable for efficiently preparing high-performance CO$_{2 }$ separation membranes was selected through a combination of experiments and simulations.

Conclusions\n\nIn this study, a PCN-224-Mn-mediated dual-reading platform was proposed for the detection of OPs residues using TMB as a common signal of color and temperature. The coordination of Mn 2 + and the porphyrin cavity of PCN-224 significantly enhanced the oxidase-like activity, which catalyzed the formation of blue -green oxTMB from colorless TMB.
