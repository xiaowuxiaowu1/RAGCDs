## ABSTRACT

Membrane separation technology can effectively address the issues of high energy consumption and low efficiency encountered in traditional separation processes. However, oil fouling hinders the widespread adoption of membrane technology in the field of oil-water separation. Therefore, preventing membrane fouling is crucial for overcoming this bottleneck. Titanium carbide (Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$, MXene), a recent addition to the two-dimensional material family, has garnered significant interest in the domain of water treatment owing to its controllable surface groups, hydrophilic nature, antimicrobial properties, and high electrical conductivity. Hence, we proposed a strategy to construct hydrogel coatings on carboxylated MXene surfaces. Moreover, the rigidity of the hydrogel framework was further improved by introducing CaCO$_{3 }$nanoparticles. A stronger hydrogel layer ensured that the hydration layer is difficult to contaminate with oil and the fastness of the membrane material. Naturally, the asprepared membrane showed excellent separation performance for a wide range of emulsions, maintaining high levels (3979.5 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 99.96 %) after 5 consecutive separation cycles of 200 min. Additionally, the membrane separated emulsions containing acids, salts, or alkali with a permeability of 2982.8 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> 1 after 40 min; it also treated actual oily wastewater achieving a permeability of 238.9 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and showed high removal efficiency ( > 99.9 %) for several heavy metals (Cu, Li, Pb, Se, and V), as well as antimicrobial (92.5 %) properties that enhance its potential for industrial applications. This study offers a new idea for designing anti-oil-fouling MXene oil-water separation membranes.

## 1. Introduction

Industrial production and human activities have generated oily wastewater rapidly, wasting resources, harming the environment, and exacerbating the freshwater crisis [1 -3]. Efficient treatment and recycling of oily wastewater is one of the effective strategies to mitigate such crises [4]. Oil slicks ( > 100 μ m), dispersed oils (10 -100 μ m), emulsified oils ( < 10 μ m), and dissolved oils are the main components of oily wastewater, and the difficulty of treatment increases with decreasing droplet size. Choosing the appropriate treatment method according to the oil droplet size is the key to realize the efficient separation of oily wastewater. Moreover, the oil removal type or water removal type is included depending on the separation objective. Compared with other traditional treatment technologies, membrane separation has the advantages of low energy consumption and high efficiency, and shows great potential for application in the water treatment field [5,6]. However, traditional membrane materials lack sufficient oil resistance,

which can easily lead to oil sticking to the membrane surface and oil droplets clogging the membrane pores, resulting in reduced separation flux [7,8]. Therefore, the development of efficient and long-time operational oil-water separation membranes is critical to promote lowenergy consumption water treatment technologies in the context of carbon neutrality.

The construction of a hydration layer on the membrane surface is fundamental to oleophobicity [9,10]. Since the surface energy of the oil phase is usually lower than that of the water phase, even if the surface of a hydrophilic modified membrane is wetted, once an oil phase breaks through the hydration layer, and direct contact with the membrane also will quickly wet its surface [11,12]. Importantly, the strength of the hydration layer determines the oil resistance of the membrane surface, which is fundamentally based on forming an oil-resistant barrier by tightly binding water molecules through hydrogen bonds [13]. This is the guiding theory behind superwettability oil-water separation membranes, which have the potential to treat oily wastewater for long-time

periods compared with that of the conventional sized-based screening membranes. However, during long-time use, the hydrophilic groups on the membrane surface are damaged or covered by liquid flushing or high-viscosity oil phase, resulting in damage to the hydration layer, affecting the wettability of the membrane and ultimately affecting its separation performance. Therefore, the stability of the grafting groups on the membrane surface and the formation of a hydration layer with water molecules are particularly important for long-time separation performance. Jin et al. [14 -17] constructed a series of hydrophilic polymer modification or hydrogel composite membranes with superb resistance to oil fouling, and these membranes were able to maintain a steady separation flux due to multiple anti-fouling strategies on their surfaces. Notably, the separation flux does not remain high while maintaining an extremely stable separation flux level; in other words, the high separation flux membranes also decrease more rapidly. Clearly, there is a similar " trade-off " effect for separated flux and its maintenance [18]. Therefore, it remains a great challenge to break through the limitations of the " trade-off " effect and develop high separation flux membrane materials that can operate for long-time periods and in complex environments.

Hence, we report a hydrogel coating strategy where a hydrogel coating was constructed on the carboxylated MXene sheets surface and CaCO$_{3 }$ nanoparticles were introduced into it to further enhance the firmness of the hydrogel. Backed by the strong hydration layer prepared by this strategy, the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane exhibited excellent wettability properties. Importantly, it showed extraordinary separation performance for a wide range of surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions and maintained a high permeability even after a long-time period of separation. Additionally, the membrane also displayed excellent separation performance and heavy metal ion treatment potential for complex oily wastewater. This strategy provides a feasible idea for the industrial progress of MXene membranes.

## 2.2. Preparation of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$ MXene suspension

The relevant experimental steps were referred to our group ' s previous reports [34]. Briefly, 1 g of LiF was mixed with 20 mL of 12 M HCl and 1 g of Ti$_{3}$AlC$_{2 }$was gradually added and reacted at 35 ℃ for 24 h. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged and washed several times to neutrality by using deionized water. The above precipitate was added with a certain amount of deionized water and sonicated in an ice bath for 1 h, centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 1 h and the supernatant was collected. Finally, the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$ MXene suspension was obtained by adjusting the concentration of the supernatant to 2 mg/mL.

2.3. Preparation of carboxyl modification Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$ MXene (MCOOH) sheets

First, 1 g of ClCH$_{2}$COOH and 1.7 g of NaOH were added to a 100 mL (2 mg/mL) of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$ MXene suspension and well dispersed by sonication. To avoid oxidation of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$MXene sheets by oxygen, argon gas (Ar) was passed into the solution for 15 min. Subsequently, the reaction system was continuously stirred at 60 ℃ for 12 h. After the reaction was completed, the system was washed to neutrality by centrifugation.

## 2.4. Preparation of MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ and MCOOH-CaTS MXene suspension

First, the above MCOOH precipitate was dispersed in 100 mL of a mixed solution containing 0.1 M CaCl$_{2 }$and 0.1 wt% TA, sonicated for 15 min, then centrifuged and washed once with deionized water. Subsequently, the resulting precipitate was sonicated in 100 mL of a 0.1 wt% concentration of SA solution for 15 min, and then centrifuged and washed once with deionized water. Excess unreacted solution needed to be removed by centrifugation prior to the deionized water washing step. Again, the above precipitate was sonicated to disperse in 100 mL of a mixed solution containing 0.1 M CaCl$_{2 }$and 0.1 wt% TA concentration and washed with water by centrifugation. The precipitate was then sonicated in 100 mL of the 0.1 M Na$_{2}$CO$_{3 }$ solution for 15 min and

The discovery of graphene sparked a research boom in twodimensional (2D) materials with remarkable properties [19]. MXene, as a young member of this family, was discovered in 2011, and has a promising prospect for research applications in the fields of energy storage and conversion, membrane separation and water treatment, biomedicine, and electromagnetic interference protection due to its high specific surface area, excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, abundant surface groups, self-lubrication, electromagnetic shielding, antimicrobials, and multiple structural morphologies [20 -22]. In addition, MXene is produced by etching elements such as " Al, Si, and Sn " in a MAX phase material, and the variety of MAX phase types also increases the diversity of MXene [23]. This also adds significantly to the potential of research on the MXene. Different etching strategies affect the types of groups on the surface of MXene, but overall, they exhibit better hydrophilicity, which is advantageous for constructing a hydration layer [24,25]. Unexpectedly, pristine MXene membrane can also exhibit some degree of emulsion separation performance [26,27]. Several studies have also shown that the separation performance or the composite treatment capability can be substantially enhanced by modifying the MXene surface groups with hydrophilic groups or mixing hydrophilic substances [28 -32]. Nonetheless, a decrease in separation flux is inevitable as the emulsions continue to be separated. Some self-cleaning MXene membranes, which were designed based on the intrinsic photocatalytic activity of the MXene, had been proven to be a viable option for sustainable separations [33]. However, to some extent, the energy consumption for the self-cleaning process is contrary to the low-energy consumption feature of membrane separation technology. Moreover, the cumbersome steps involved also add to the difficulty of industrial applications. Therefore, it is quite challenging to achieve stable and sustainable emulsions separation on the membrane surface only by building a strong hydration layer.

centrifuged and washed with water. At this point, one cycle of the entire reaction had been executed, and the procedure was then repeated four times for a total of 5 cycles labelled as MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3}$. Furthermore, the MCOOH precipitate was dispersed by sonication in above same CaCl$_{2}$(0.1 M)/TA(0.1 wt%) and SA(0.1 wt%) solutions, respectively, for one cycle, and the same procedure was performed for 5 cycles labelled as MCOOH-CaTS.

## 2.5. Fabrication of MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane

Briefly, the membrane material was prepared by filtering the suspension over a commercial PVDF membrane. To begin with, the concentration of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$suspension was adjusted to 2 mg/ mL. The MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$suspension was filtered on a PVDF substrate membrane and the actual mass of the sample was obtained by weighing the membrane before and after filtration. The diameter of the sample was 3.9 cm and the effective area was 11.94 cm$^{2}$. To ensure that there was about a 10 mg sample mass on the substrate membrane and the membrane was stored in water for preservation and labelled as the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane. Meanwhile, the suspensions of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$ MXene, MCOOH, and MCOOH-CaTS were used to prepare their corresponding membranes, denoted as MXene, MCOOH, and MCOOH-CaTS membranes, by the same method.

To sum up, the preparation process consists of two parts, preparing the MXene sheets and preparing the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membranes (Fig. 1). Initially, using the LiF/HCl in-situ etching method, the " Al " atomic layer in the Ti$_{3}$AlC$_{2 }$ MAX phase ceramic material was directionally etched to obtain the accordion-like multilayer Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$. The multilayer Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$ was exfoliated by ultrasound and centrifuged to collect the single-layer Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$MXene sheets. Subsequently, the MXene sheet surface was modified with carboxyl groups to endow its surface with more hydrophilic groups (Fig. S1). Importantly, the carboxyl groups on the MXene sheets surface were mutually attracted to Ca 2 + and TA by electrostatic forces. Moreover, TA can contribute to antimicrobial and hydrophilicity enhancement. Meanwhile, based on the fact that SA and Ca 2 + intrinsically can form hydrogel, SA was introduced into the above system to obtain a hydrogel protective layer on the MXene sheets surface [35,36]. Furthermore, the introduced CO$_{3}$ 2 GLYPH<0> anion also coordinated with Ca 2 + to form CaCO$_{3 }$nanoparticles, which could help support the hydrogel structure. The whole process was repeated for five cycles to obtain the corresponding suspensions. Finally, due to the high mechanical strength, toughness, and chemical stability of a PVDF substrate membrane, the suspension was filtered on it to obtain the MCOOH-

CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane.

## 2.6. Membrane separation performance

Three oil phases ( n -hexane, kerosene, and rapeseed oil) with different viscosities were employed to prepare SDS-stabilized oil-inwater emulsions. 16 mL of oil phase was added to 1600 mL of deionized water and 320 mg of SDS was added to the deionized water beforehand. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred for 10 min under the action of a laboratory high-speed dispersion homogenizer at 4000 rpm.

The entire separation process was carried out in a cross-flow filtration device. In addition, the effective filtration area of the membrane device was 11.94 cm$^{2 }$and a transmembrane pressure of 0.1 bar was applied. The filtrate mass was recorded per 2 min, from which the realtime separation flux was calculated. The permeance F (L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) and separation efficiency ( R ) can be measured according to the following equations:

Where V (L) is the volume of filtrate, A (m$^{2}$) is the effective filtration area of the membrane device, Δ t (h) is the corresponding operation time of the filtrate volume, Δ p (bar) is the transmembrane pressure, C$_{0 }$ (mg/ L) is the oil content of the feed emulsions, and C$_{1 }$ (mg/L) is the oil content of the filtrate. Additionally, the ion removal rate (antimicrobial rate or SDS separation efficiency) can be calculated by Eq. (2) when C$_{0 }$ and C$_{1 }$ represent the feed ion concentration (number of colonies in the blank group or SDS content in feed) and the filtrate ion concentration (number of colonies in the experimental group or SDS content in filtrate), respectively.

## 2.7. Antimicrobial testing of membrane

The MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane was cut into 1.5 × 3.5 cm size and placed in a disposable petri dish and sterilized by UV irradiation for 30 min on each side. The E. coli bacterial solution was diluted to 10$^{6 }$CFU/ mL with Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid. Subsequently, the membrane was transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube, 30 mL of diluted bacterial solution was added, and it was placed in a 37 ℃ thermostat for 24 h of static incubation. After the incubation was completed, the membrane was transferred to a new centrifuge tube, washed with 15 mL of LB liquid and the wash solution collected. The wash solution was then diluted

Chemical Engineering Journal 482 (2024) 148971 Long et al.

with 10$^{4 }$or 10$^{5 }$times with sterile PBS solution. Then, 100 μ L of the dilution solution was evenly coated on LB solid medium and placed in a constant temperature oven at 37 ℃ for 18 h. Finally, they were removed for photographing and recording the number of colonies. The same procedure was repeated with the PVDF substrate membrane as a control.

## 2.8. Characterization

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained on a JEOL/JSM-7610FPlus (Japan). The thickness of single-layer MXene sheets was measured by the atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker, USA). Transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) was used to observe the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ suspension. The surface roughness of MXene membrane materials were determined by optical profilometer measurement (Bruker Countor GT K 3D). The X-ray polycrystalline powder diffractometer (XRD, Ultima IV Rigaku, Corporation) was employed to characterize the crystal structure of the MXene membrane materials. Pore size distributions of the membranes were determined by a membrane pore size analyzer (Beishide Instrument Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd., BSD-PB). Chemical groups on the surface of MXene sheets were analyzed by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrometer) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha). Underwater oil contact angles were measured using an angle measuring instrument (JC 2000D1, Zhongchen Digital Equipment Co. Ltd., China). The infrared oil measuring instrument (HX-OIL-10, Huaxin Rui (Qingdao) Analysis Instrument Co., Ltd.) and total organic carbon analyzer (Jena Multi N/C 3100, Germany) were applied to analyze the oil content or SDS content of feed emulsions and filtrates. The particle size or Zeta potential data of the samples ' suspension, feed emulsions, and filtrates were characterized by a particle size analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS instrument ZEN3600) or a digital optical microscope (XSP-BM-30 AD, China). The ion concentration in extractant waste solution and filtrate were measured using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Avio 500).

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Preparation and structure characterization of membranes

First of all, SEM and AFM were employed to confirm the successful preparation of MXene sheets for the first part of the experiment. As shown in Fig. 2a, the morphology of the Ti$_{3}$AlC$_{2 }$ MAX phase ceramic material resembled a large monolithic block, clearly exhibiting its tightly bonded layered structure. The MAX phase was etched by the " HCl/LiF " etchant and demonstrated a typical accordion-like multilayer Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$(Fig. 2b), indicating that the " Al " atomic layer was successfully removed by etching and the reaction proceeded. Meanwhile, the AFM results indicated that the thickness of the exfoliated MXene sheet was about 1.6 nm (Fig. 2c), confirming the successful preparation of MXene sheets. The TEM was utilized to understand the formation of the hydrogel layer on the MXene surface. As illustrated in Fig. 2d -g, the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$had a block structure with folded lamellae, a threedimensional (3D) crosslinked network of hydrogel layers were clearly observed at its edges [37]. Furthermore, an interplanar spacing value of 0.409 nm, which corresponded to the (020) crystal plane of CaCO$_{3}$, was observed, proving that CaCO$_{3 }$ nanoparticles were successfully introduced into the hydrogel layer [38]. Meanwhile, the dynamic light scattering (DLS) results showed that the particulate matter in the suspension gradually converged to unity with the gradual modification (Fig. S2). The surface microscopic morphologies and specific appearance of various MXene-based membranes were observed by SEM and digital photos (Fig. S3a). As illustrated in Fig. 3a and b, the MCOOH membrane surface consisted of blocks and nanoparticles with some pores and slits. In comparison, the MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membranes had similar surface morphologies, both consisting of large massive lamellae with many pores and cracks (Fig. 3d -h). The MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membranes had average pore diameters of 0.19, 0.27, and 0.52 μ m, respectively; and they had porosities of 62.57, 70.20, and 75.31 %, respectively (Fig. S4). Larger average pore diameters and porosities indicated that the MCOOH-CaTS/ CO$_{3 }$ membrane could exhibit higher permeability. To further understand the membrane surface roughness and thicknesses, an optical

profilometer and cross-section SEM were employed to characterize it. Based on the 3D surface contour image results, the surface roughness of the MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membranes were 6.3007, 6.8910, and 7.7803 μ m, respectively. Moreover, their thicknesses were 4.76, 4.93, and 5.22 μ m respectively (Fig. S5). This result indicated that both constructing the hydrogel layer and introducing CaCO$_{3 }$nanoparticles can improve the membrane surface roughness and

thicknesses. Meanwhile, based on the wettability principle, greater roughness implied an enhanced wettability state, suggesting the possibility that it would show better separation performance [11].

To further understand the changes in the crystal structure of the MAX phase after etching and membranes and hydrogel layer formation, XRD was utilized for characterization. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, Ti$_{3}$AlC$_{2 }$ exhibited (002) and (104) characteristic peaks of MAX phase ceramic

Fig. 4. (a) XRD patterns of Ti$_{3}$AlC$_{2}$, multilayer Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$, MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membranes, (b) FT-IR spectra of MXene, MCOOH, MCOOHCaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3}$, (c) XPS survey spectra, (d) C 1 s, (e) O 1 s, and (f) Ti 2p of MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membranes.

materials according to JCPDS PDF#52 -0875 [39]. Moreover, after etching, the (002) characteristic peak of multilayers Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$was shifted from 9.58 · to 6.86 · and the (104) peak was weakened significantly, indicating that the " Al " layer was successfully etched away. Meanwhile, the oxidation of MXene sheets during carboxylation caused the broadening and weakening of the (002) characteristic peak of the MCOOH membrane. In contrast, the MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membranes had more pronounced (002) characteristic peaks that shifted negatively compared with that of the multilayer Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$. Additionally, the (002) peak of the MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS and MCOOH-CaTS/ CO$_{3 }$membranes were at 5.63, 6.30, and 5.42 · , respectively. Therefore, the layer spacing of the multilayers Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$, MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membranes were calculated from the Bragg ' s formula as 1.29, 1.57, 1.40, and 1.63 nm, respectively [40]. Interestingly, the introduction of CaCO$_{3 }$ nanoparticles increased the layer spacing of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane slightly, compared with that of the MCOOH-CaTS membrane.

To further investigate the surface groups of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$MXene, MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3}$, FT-IR and XPS were utilized to characterize them. Since "-OH " and " C = O " groups were easily introduced to the surface of the MXene sheets during the etching stage, especially using the " LiF/HCl " etchant. Therefore, MXene exhibited

distinct "-OH " and " C = O " stretching vibrational peaks at 3278 and 1633 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively (Fig. 4b). Moreover, MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ showed the same peaks. Meanwhile, the MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$had very small " C-O " and " C-OC " stretching vibrational peaks at 1182 and 1027 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively, which were due to the TA and SA stretching vibrational peaks (Fig. S6) [41,42]. This result proved that TA and SA formed a hydrogel coating on MCOOH surface. Similarly, in the XPS results (Fig. 4c), MCOOH-CaTS and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ appeared as characteristic peaks of Ca 2p at the binding energy of 348 eV, indicating that Ca 2 + ions involved in the construction of the hydrogel coating. In the high-resolution C 1 s spectra of MCOOH-CaTS and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$(Fig. 4d), the peak area of " TiC " decreased slightly compared with that of MCOOH. Inversely, the peak area of " C-C " of MCOOH-CaTS and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ increased significantly. This was attributed to the hydrogel layer on the MXene sheet surface. Besides, the " O 1 s " peak intensity and " C-O " peak area of MCOOH increased significantly compared with MXene and also proved that the carboxylation was successfully carried out (Fig. S7). The peak area of " C-O " of MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ was much larger than that of MCOOH-CaTS, indicating that the CaCO$_{3 }$ nanoparticles were successfully introduced into the hydrogel coating. The significantly increased peak area of " Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ " in MCOOH-CaTS and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$can also

be attributed to the hydrogel coating coverage (Fig. 4e). In the highresolution O 1 s and Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 4f), the peak area of " TiO$_{2}$ " of MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ decreased gradually. This result indicated that the " TiO$_{2}$ " , which was generated by the carboxylation process, was gradually covered by the hydrogel coating. Besides, this point was also confirmed by the gradual weakening of the Ti 2p peak intensity in the XPS survey spectra and the decrease of different peak areas in the high-resolution Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 4f). Thus, both FI-IR and XPS results proved that the MXene surface was covered with the hydrogel coating and that CaCO$_{3 }$nanoparticles were successfully introduced into the hydrogel.

## 3.2. Wettability of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane

Excellent wettability properties are a precursor condition for emulsion separation, and are also a direct reflection of the firmness of the hydration layer on the membrane surface under the hydrogel coating build. Therefore, the wettability performance of the membrane was evaluated by measuring underwater oil contact angles (CAs), sliding angles (SAs), and anti-oil adhesion tests. Firstly, the underwater CAs and SAs of the membrane were measured with different viscosity oil phases. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane exhibited underwater superoleophobicity property for a wide range of oil phases including heavy and light oils, concretely underwater CAs all greater than 150 · . Moreover, the underwater SAs were all less than 10 · , implying that the membranes had favorable anti-oil adhesion. Subsequently, a high-speed camera was employed to collect continuous digital photographs to further explore the dynamic anti-oil adhesion properties of the membrane. The oil droplets were extruded as far as possible onto the membrane surface and subsequently moved away, and then the shapes of the oil droplets were compared in the photographs taken at

0.05 s intervals before and after. By comparing the contact of the eight oil phases, it was easy to observe that both oil droplets in the photographs kept the same shape and left the membrane surface without any adhesion (Fig. 5b, Fig. S8). To further understand the oil resistance of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane, a large number of oil droplets were sprayed or dripped on the membrane surface. As illustrated in Fig. 5c and Video 1, many kerosene oil droplets were sprayed onto the membrane surface via a syringe, and they all bounced back without leaving any traces of oil fouling on the membrane surface. The experimental dropper dripped highly viscous lubricating oil onto the MCOOH-CaTS/ CO$_{3 }$ membrane surface (Fig. 5d and Video 2). After immersing the membrane in water, the oil droplets rapidly floated up, showing a selfcleaning phenomenon. These results indicated that the oil droplets failed to contact the base material on the membrane surface, and showed excellent anti-oil adhesion properties under the action of the hydration layer.

## 3.3. Oil-in-water emulsions separation of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane

The separation performance of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane was evaluated by separating emulsions prepared from different viscosities oil phases and stabilized by SDS surfactant. The entire separation process took place on a cross-flow device. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, c and e, after membrane separation, all three emulsions were transformed from milky white to transparent and colorless filtrate. When observed under the microscope, a large number of oil droplets had disappeared and no trace of oil droplets could be observed in the filtrate. The oil droplet sizes of n -hexane, kerosene, and rapeseed oil emulsions were predominantly distributed at 1110 -4150, 1280 -3090, and 4145 -6440 nm, while their filtrates were predominantly at 78 -122, 142 -459, and

43 -459 nm, respectively (Fig. 6b, d and f). The particle size distribution of the filtrate after the as-prepared membrane separation of SDS solution was 28 -68 nm, indicating the presence of SDS micelles or small size oil droplets in the filtrate (Fig. S9a). Thus, the oil droplets could be effectively separated.

During the preparation of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ suspension, the

To further investigate the real-time separation performance of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane, the separation permeability was monitored and calculated using the real-time measurement method. Beforehand, to highlight the enhancement of separation performance by the modification process, PVDF and MXene membranes were utilized to separate the n -hexane emulsion. As illustrated in Fig. S9b, in the first cycle, the PVDF membrane exhibited ultra-high water permeability, but the permeability decreased rapidly with emulsion oil separating; and in the second cycle, despite a small increased in water permeability, it gradually tended to 348.7 L m -2 h GLYPH<0> 1 bar GLYPH<0> 1 after the third cycle. In contrast, the overall permeability of the MXene membrane tended to a relatively smooth range, and after the third cycle, the permeability of the emulsion separating also tended to 377.5 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. The PVDF and MXene membranes exhibited lower separation permeabilities because they lacked sufficient resistance to oil fouling, resulting in membrane pores blockage during the separation process. Subsequently, the permeance and oil content in filtrate of the MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membranes separating n -hexane emulsions were measured, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, Fig. S10a, and Table S1, these membranes exhibited the similar separation permeability trends and filtrates properties, with a clear downward trend in the first cycle followed by approach to 1891.6, 2211.5, and 3979.5 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in the third cycle; the oil content in filtrates (separation efficiency) were 0.575 (99.98 %), 1.146 (99.96 %), and 1.077 (99.96 %), respectively. There were little differences in the oil content of the filtrates and the separation efficiencies. Therefore, the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane showed the best separation permeance among these three membranes, and subsequent studies will be focus on it.

thickness of the hydrogel coating on the MXene sheet surface was closely related to the preparation cycle and directly affected the separation performance. Similarly, the membranes, which were prepared by the suspensions from different preparation cycle periods, were measured for the emulsion separation permeability. As illustrated in Fig. 7b, the membrane with 5 cycles represented the best separation performance and showed the highest final permeability (3979.5 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1}$). Additionally, the oil content of the filtrates separated by these membranes was not high ( < 1.2 mg/L), and the difference in separation efficiency was not significant ( > 99.95 %, Fig. S10b and Table S1). The huge difference in performance between a PVDF membrane and MCOOH, MCOOH-CaTS, and MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membranes was essentially due to the different functionalized MXene sheets that were filtered at the substrate membrane. Since the MXene-based membrane was obtained by MXene sheets stacking on a substrate membrane, the stack thickness can be reflected by the corresponding mass. A stack that was too thick would increase the transmission path and decrease the permeance; conversely, too thin a stack would increase the probability of direct contact between the oil and the substrate membrane, destroying the oleophobic layer and affecting the separation performance. Therefore, there was a need to explore the separation performance of membranes with different loading masses. As shown in Fig. 7c, it was clear that the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane showed the best separation permeance when the loading mass was 10 mg. With a loading mass of 5 mg, the membrane exhibited a high initial permeability in the first cycle, followed by a rapid decrease and gradually minimized in the third cycle. In contrast, the membrane with a loading mass of 15 mg, which had little fluctuation in permeability, also showed a similar trend. Meanwhile, the oil content in the filtrates decreased with the increasing loading mass, but the reduction was minor, the overall oil contents were all less than 1.3 mg/L, and the separation efficiencies were greater than 99.95 % (Fig. S10c and Table S1). Therefore, subsequent separation performance studies would focus on the membrane material with a loading mass of 10 mg and the suspensions prepared by 5 cycles.

To further investigate the separation performance of the MCOOHCaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane, we attempted to separate kerosene, rapeseed oil emulsion, and practical sample emulsions. As illustrated in Fig. 7d, 7e, the permeability of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane showed a decreasing trend when separating both kerosene and rapeseed oil emulsions. At the end of the third cycle, the permeability was 3315.9 and 2883.4 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. Additionally, the separation cycles of n -hexane emulsion by the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane was increased to the fifth cycle, and it was evident that the permeability eventually tended to 3621.4 and 3585.6 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in the fourth and fifth cycles, respectively (Fig. 7f). To further understand the permeability changed, we introduced the permeance recovery ratio (FRR) and each cycle permeance decay ratio (FD). As illustrated in Fig. S11a, the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane showed the highest FRR value for the kerosene-in-water emulsion separation, indicating that it had faster permeability recovery when separating the kerosene emulsion. In contrast, the FD values for separating kerosene emulsions were gradually increasing, indicating a significant decreased in permeance at the later stages of the separation cycle, while the permeances gradually leveled off when separating rapeseed oil and n -hexane emulsions (Fig. S11b). Additionally, the oil content and separation efficiency of each filtrate were as follows: kerosene (0.465 mg/L, 99.94 %), rapeseed oil (0.726 mg/L, 99.99 %), and n -hexane (1.077 mg/L, 99.96 %) (Fig. S11c). To investigate the SDS separation efficiency, we characterized the filtrate by determining the TOC content, the kerosene, rapeseed oil, and n -hexane SDS separation efficiencies were 63.19, 61.01, and 60.17 %, respectively (Fig. S11d). This also corroborated the possibility that SDS micelles were retained in the filtrate. These separation results showed that the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane exhibited both high

separation permeability after continuous cycling and excellent cyclic separation performance.

During the actual separation process, the emulsion may contain acids, salts, or alkalis, which put a huge test on the stability of the membrane material. The MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membranes were immersed in acidic, saline, or alkaline environments for 24 h, respectively, followed by simple cleaning with deionized water measurement of its kerosene wettability parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 8a, it still exhibited an underwater superoleophobic wettability state (CAs > 150 · ) and lower SAs. The microscopic morphology after acid treatment became smooth with obvious etch marks, which can be attributed to the dissolution of CaCO$_{3 }$particles by hydrochloric acid, whereas there was no significant change in the morphology after salt and alkali treatments (Fig. S12). Furthermore, the membrane separated the acid, salt, and alkali emulsions resulted in permeabilities of 5212.2, 2982.8, and 3437.7 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively (Fig. 8b). The MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane was employed to separate the copper extractant waste solution, which contained a variety of metal ions, aldehyde groups, and oxime groups, and the solution was acidic (pH~2). By comparing the digital photos before and after the separation, the waste solution transformed from a turbid yellow solution to a clarified yellow filtrate with a slight lightening of the yellow color (Fig. 8c). Moreover, the microscopic photo did not observe large sized oil droplets in the filtrate. The oil droplets in the waste solution were mainly distributed in 1480 -6440 nm, and in filtrate they were 0.5 -1.3 nm (Fig. 8d). The permeability of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane separation the copper extractant waste solution finally tended to 238.9 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> 1 (Fig. 8e). Additionally, the membrane showed excellent removal efficiency of oil and Cu, Li, Pb, Se, and V ions by measuring the oil content

and ion concentrations of the waste solution and filtrate (Fig. 8f and Table S2). The ions removal efficiency can also be calculated from Eq. (2) . The removal effect of heavy metal ions could be attributed to the adsorption of metal ions caused by the membrane. Based on the zeta potential result (Fig. S13), the heavy metal adsorption mechanism can be attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the cationic metal and the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane and the large number of chelation sites in the hydrogel coating that were coordinated to the metal ions. [43]. These results showed that the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane exhibited the possibility of treatment complex systems and actual emulsions.

To investigate the potential of the membrane materials assembly into membrane modules and long-time flushing stability, the membranes were continuously bent 200 times or placed at a height of 70 cm and flushed with about 3 L/min tap-water. As illustrated in Fig. S14, the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane was continuously bent 200 times without any sample dropping. Obviously, the MCOOH-CaTS membrane left a visible sample vacancy after washing with tap-water, while MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane was intact, suggesting that CaCO$_{3 }$ particles can significantly enhance the firmness of the hydrogel coating (Fig. S15 and Video 3). Furthermore, the hydrophilic type PVDF substrate membrane to a certain extent can to some extent be firmly bonded to the suspension due to the electrostatic attraction between hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (Fig. S16).

## 3.4. Antimicrobial properties of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane

A large number of microorganisms typically exist in the actual water treatment progress, and these microorganisms attach to the membrane surface to form numerous colonies, which affects the original wettability of the membrane and plugs membrane pores. Ultimately, this affects the separation performance of the membrane material and reduces its service life. Moreover, the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x }$ MXene has been widely reported as a superior antimicrobial material [44]. Therefore, to understand the antimicrobial effect of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane, the E. coli was selected as the target strain. A commercial PVDF substrate membrane was employed as a blank control group. As illustrated in Fig. 9a, b, e, and f, the number of the E. coli colonies was significantly reduced in the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane group compared with that of the PVDF membrane group. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial rates were calculated by comparing the number of colonies in the experimental and blank

groups, which can be calculated using Eq. (2) . Thus, the antimicrobial rates of the membrane were calculated by the E. coli colonies to be 78.86 % and 92.5 % at dilutions of 10$^{4 }$and 10$^{5}$, respectively, indicating its remarkable antibacterial activity. Compared with the microscopic morphology of the bacteria on the PVDF membrane, the cell wall of the bacteria on the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane appeared visibly wrinkled, indicating a change in cell membrane permeability (Fig. 9c, d, g, and h). This can be attributed to the fact that the hydrogel coating released the TA, as well as MXene sheets at the edges in direct contact with the bacterial surface and induced a change in physical pressure, which together led to the disruption of the bacterial membrane [45,46]. Thus, the certain antimicrobial property of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane provided a great guarantee for its long-time oily wastewater separation. The membrane had some advantages of long treatment, simple continuous operation, antibacterial, and heavy metal removal (Table 1) over some MXene-based membrane materials. These advantages would further contribute to the industrialization possibilities of this membrane.

## 3.5. The mechanism of long-time emulsions separation

To further understand the role of the hydrogel coating and CaCO$_{3 }$ nanoparticles in enhancing the separation performance of the MCOOHCaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane, we simulated the entire separation process using a hypothetical schematic. Firstly, when the MCOOH membrane separated the emulsion (Fig. 10a), the lack of solid enough hydrophilicity caused the collapse of the hydration layer during a long separation process, resulting in weakening anti-oil adhesion of the membrane, and the oil droplets easily adhered around the membrane pores or its surface. This was ultimately manifested in the low permeability. To solve this problem, the hydrogel coating, which had the stronger water retention capacity, was constructed on the MCOOH surface to further enhance the robustness of the hydration layer. Unfortunately, after long time separation, the hydrogel coating also collapsed due to inadequate support, resulting in damage to the hydration layer (Fig. 10b). Ultimately, the MCOOH-CaTS membrane exhibited unimpressive permeability. So furthermore, the additional construction of CaCO$_{3 }$nanoparticles in the original hydrogel coating ensured that it was stronger and the hydration layer was less susceptible to breakage during long time separation (Fig. 10c). Meanwhile, during cross-flow separation, shear force will spontaneously wash away the oil droplets on the membrane surface, and

only a small portion of small sized oil droplets may fall into the membrane pores, realizing the self-cleaning effect.

To understand the emulsion separation mechanism, we introduced the breakthrough pressure ( Δ P ) to validate it. Δ P can be calculated using the Young-Laplace equation and assuming that each membrane pore is a

Since SDS is an anionic surfactant, in order to understand the emulsion separation mechanism from the charge point of view, we tested the zeta potential of SDS-stabilized emulsions and MCOOH-CaTS/ CO$_{3 }$ (Fig. S13). The MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane was an anionic separation membrane. When separating anionic emulsions, the SDS on the oil droplet surface would be aggregated to the other side under the effect of electrostatic repulsion (Fig. 10d). Subsequently, the oil droplets broken up and the SDS may aggregate to form micelles, which subsequently flowed away by cross-cutting forces or fell into the membrane pores or filtrates. Importantly, the presence of a large charge repulsion between the membrane and the emulsion, making it more difficult to contaminate the membrane surface [47]. Furthermore, some free SDS monomers, the hydrophilic head would be repelled due to charge repulsion, and the hydrophobic tail would be difficult to intrude into the hydration layer, which ultimately made the SDS monomers not easy to stay on the membrane surface. It was difficult for SDS to affect the basic properties of the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane surface. Therefore, it unsurprisingly exhibited the most excellent permeability.

Where γ $_{L }$is the surface tension at the oil-water interface; θ is the contact angle between the oil-water interface and the capillary wall, that is, the contact angle of the liquid on the membrane surface; r$_{p }$ is the radius of the capillary, that is, the radius of the membrane pore. The MCOOHCaTS/CO$_{3 }$membrane showed a superhydrophilic wettability state in air, while its water CA was 0 · (Fig. S17). The value of Δ P can be calculated by the formula to be less than 0, indicating that the water can spontaneously pass through the membrane pore without restriction (Fig. 10e). In contrast, the contact angle θ was greater than 150 · when the membrane showed the underwater superoleophobic wettability state, and Δ P was calculated to be greater than 0, indicating that oil droplets cannot pass through the membrane pore (Fig. 10f). Thus, the MCOOH-CaTS/ CO$_{3 }$membrane was able to separate oil-in-water emulsions when it was wetted with water beforehand.

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, we constructed a hydrogel coating on the carboxylated

Chemical Engineering Journal 482 (2024) 148971 Long et al.

MXene sheets surface and introduced CaCO$_{3 }$ nanoparticles to further promote the stabilization of the hydrogel network structure. The robust hydrogel coating ensured the strong hydration layer, which achieved that the MCOOH-CaTS/CO$_{3 }$ membrane exhibited excellent wettability and anti-oil adhesion properties. As a result, the membrane was able to separate surfactant-stabilized emulsions for long periods of time and showed high permeability and efficiency (3979.5 L m -$^{2 }$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$bar GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 99.96 %) in the later stages of the separation process. Additionally, in the face of acidic, saline, and alkaline environments and harsh separation objects, it can still maintain remarkable stability and separation performance. Meanwhile, certain antimicrobial properties and heavy metal removal capabilities open up the possibility of practical use of the membrane. This strategy provides a new idea to realize the MXene membrane in the sustainable treatment of oily wastewater.
