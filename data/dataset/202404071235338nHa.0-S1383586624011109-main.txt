## ABSTRACT

Water resources contamination by both oil and microplastics (MPs) stands as a pressing environmental concern. To tackle this challenge, we have devised a superhydrophobic magnetic biomass aerogel, synthesized from PDMS-modified carbonized ZIF-67/chitosan (PDMS@CZIF-67/CS). This aerogel exhibits remarkable capabilities in oil/water separation and adsorption of a wide range of emerging pollutants due to its inherent superhydrophobicity, stability, and self-cleaning capabilities. Furthermore, the aerogel demonstrates efficient absorption of viscous oils and facilitates self-driven oil absorption through the synergistic photothermal conversion and magnetic properties of CZIF-67, respectively. After ten consecutive separation cycles, the aerogel consistently maintains its efficiency in oil/water separation, regardless of the employed method, whether gravitydriven or facilitated by a peristaltic pump. Notably, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel manifests a high adsorption capacity for various emerging pollutants, specifically MPs, achieving an almost complete adsorption efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative, eco-friendly approach aimed at mitigating oil-contaminated wastewater and emerging pollutants, highlighting its potential for widespread application.

## 1. Introduction

Water pollution has become a critical global issue, largely due to the rapid expansion of industrialization and anthropogenic activities. The presence of emerging pollutants, such as microplastics (MPs) [1], antibiotics [2], and dyes [3] in water has raised significant concerns regarding their potential hazards to human health and the environment. These contaminants pose urgent environmental challenges that require prompt solutions. The development of sustainable materials and technologies for purifying water from various contaminated sources, including sewage, industrial effluents, and polluted natural waters, is of paramount importance. However, the development of separation materials that can effectively purify complex oily wastewater is challenging due to the robust nature of oil/water interactions and the diverse composition of such effluents [4]. The coexistence of oils with other harmful emerging pollutants, including MPs and their derivatives [5], antibiotics, and dyes, further complicates the purification process. Despite the development of various filtration [6 -9] and adsorption materials [10 -13], many existing solutions are limited by their monofunctionality, targeting only specific types of wastewater. A

multifunctional material, often termed an " all-around soldier " , capable of comprehensively treating complex oily wastewater, is notably lacking. There is a pressing need for innovative, multifunctional materials that integrate filtration, adsorption, separation, and regeneration capabilities, while remaining cost-effective and eco-friendly. Such materials are essential for the efficient and sustainable removal of oils and other pollutants in wastewater treatment.

In recent years, superhydrophobic materials have gained popularity for their exceptional oil absorption selectivity and water-repellent properties, making them ideal for oil/water mixture and emulsion separation [14 -16]. These materials also boast self-cleaning, anti-icing, and antibacterial attributes, which enhance their effectiveness in wastewater purification [17]. Aerogels stand out as particularly promising adsorbents due to their high porosity, elasticity, low density, and rich functional group content, qualities that make them well-suited for water treatment applications [18]. The open 3D network of aerogels promotes efficient pollutant mass transfer, significantly improving adsorption efficacy. However, despite the potential of customized superhydrophobic aerogels in water purification, current research predominantly targets oil/water separation, with few studies exploring the removal of MPs and

other emerging contaminants. Therefore, there is a pressing demand for the development of multifunctional superhydrophobic/superoleophilic aerogels using sustainable, renewable resources through a facile synthesis process.

To augment pollutant adsorption capabilities, the pioneering works have revealed that the integration of aerogels with carbon nanomaterials significantly improves adsorption performance by modifying the structure of pure aerogels [22,24]. Carbonized ZIF-67 (CZIF-67) exhibits exceptional organic pollutant adsorption capacities due to its hierarchical porosity, large specific surface area, and evenly distributed basic nitrogen sites [25,26]. Moreover, CZIF-67 ' s intrinsic magnetism allows for easy recovery using external magnetic fields, a desirable trait for creating reusable sorbents [27]. By exploiting the synergistic properties of both components, the incorporation of CZIF-67 is anticipated to bolster the porous structures and adsorption capabilities of CS aerogels, enhancing their organic pollutant adsorption and magnetic responsiveness. This approach circumvents the challenges associated with the use of powdered forms. Consequently, the superhydrophobic magnetic CZIF-67/CS aerogels are expected to be highly effective in oil/water separation and the removal of emerging pollutants from water.

In the realm of water remediation, biomass-derived materials are increasingly favored as aerogel matrices [19,20]. Chitosan (CS), a biocompatible and biodegradable natural polysaccharide, has attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable adsorption capabilities. Drawing inspiration from the active adsorption and passive adhesion mechanisms of corals towards MPs, CS aerogels have been designed to mimic these surface interactions, leading to enhanced removal efficiency for micron-sized MPs [21]. However, the focus on chitosan aerogels has primarily been on the adsorption of metal ions, with relatively less research on organic pollutant adsorption [22,23]. Therefore, it is of considerable practical importance to improve the comprehensive adsorption capacity of CS-based aerogels for a broader range of emerging contaminants.

This study introduces a facile, economical, and eco-friendly PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, showcasing its strategic synthesis and innovative multifunctional applications in water purification (Scheme 1). The integration of PDMS and CZIF-67 into the CS aerogel significantly enhances its superhydrophobicity, robustness, and surface area,

endowing it with superior oil/water separation efficiency and contaminant adsorption capabilities, such as microplastics (MPs), their derivatives, antibiotics, and dyes. Its magneto-responsive and photothermal conversion features enable autonomous oil absorption under magnetic fields, facilitating the treatment of high-viscosity oils and streamlining the separation process. Moreover, the aerogel ' s stability under extreme pH, high temperatures, and salinity conditions, and ensures its suitability for practical applications. This work contributes to the development of versatile bio-based adsorbents for effective water remediation.

Organic solvents (ethanol, n -hexane, N , N -dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate) were purchased from Tianjin Yongda Chemical reagent Co., LtD. Engine oil was obtained from China National Petroleum Corporation. Peanut oil and olive oil were purchased from the local supermarket. The polystyrene (PS-488 nm) microplastics (MPs) were purchased from Tianjin Baseline Chromtech Research Centre. All chemicals and solvents are analytical grade and used as received without further purification.

## 2.2. Preparation of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel

The main steps for the preparation of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel are shown in Fig. 2 (a). First, the synthesis of ZIF-67 followed the protocol outlined in the relevant literature [25]. 2.9104 g of Co(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O was dissolved in 100 mL of methanol to form solution A, while 3.2842 g of 2methylimidazole was dissolved in 100 mL of methanol to form solution B. Solution A was gradually added to solution B with constant stirring for

24 h at room temperature. The collected precipitates underwent three washes with methanol before being dried at 60 ℃ for 12 h. Subsequently, the acquired ZIF-67 was heated at a rate of 1 ℃ min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$to 600 ℃ in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h. The ultimate carbonized product was named CZIF-67.

Finally, 0.847 g of PDMS and its corresponding curing agent were dissolved in 50 mL of n -hexane, which was stirred for 5 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension. The CZIF-67/CS aerogel was immersed in the solution for 30 min, then the whole sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 ℃ for 2 h. The synthesized aerogel was labeled as PDMS@CZIF67/CS.

Subsequently, xCZIF-67/CS aerogel was prepared using the freezedrying method. Firstly, 0.200 g or 0.400 g of CZIF-67 was added to 20 mL of deionized water and treated with ultrasound for 10 min. Subsequently, 2.0 g of CS was introduced into the previously mentioned mixture, followed by the gradual addition of 0.8 mL acetic acid solution to the entire system, resulting in the formation of a highly viscous solution by vigorous stirring. To obtain CZIF-67/CS aerogel, the mixed solution was frozen for 12 h in a refrigerator and then freeze-dried at GLYPH<0> 80 ℃ for 24 h. The resulting aerogel was referred to as xCZIF-67/CS (where x = 10 and 20), with 'x ' indicating the mass percentage of CZIF-67 to CS. In order to compare the effects of the composites, pure CS aerogel was also prepared using the same preparation method as the xCZIF-67/CS aerogel, except that the CZIF-67 was not introduced.

## 2.3. Oil absorption experiments

The absorption capacity of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was determined for different oils (engine oil, peanut oil, olive oil) and organic solvents ( n -hexane, N , N -dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate). The PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel (1 × 1 × 1 cm) was immersed in different oils for a certain period of time. The absorption capacities ( Q , mg/g) of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was calculated for a range of oils or organic solvents according to the Eq. (1).

where m$_{0 }$ and m$_{1 }$ are the weight of the aerogel before and after saturated oil absorption, respectively.

Absorption experiments were also conducted for low-density and high-viscosity oils using magnetic and solar-driven methods. The lowdensity oils in water were absorbed and removed by the magnet, while the high viscosity oil droplets with a volume of 10 μ L were dropped onto the aerogel surface and their corresponding infiltration process was observed under the influence of solar radiation generated by a solar simulator.

To assess the recyclability of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, the aerogel was subjected to saturation with various oils and organic solvents. After saturation, the absorbed substances were expelled through gentle pressure to release a significant portion, followed by washing with anhydrous ethanol and vacuum drying to facilitate controlled desorption. Subsequently, the absorption -desorption cycle could be repeated, thereby fulfilling the recycling objective.

## 2.4. Oil/water separation experiments

Based on the density and viscosity of oils, two sets of self-designed apparatus were conducted for oil/water separation tests. The immiscible oil/water mixtures used in this work were obtained by simply mixing oils (dyed red) and water (dyed blue) at a volume ratio of 1:1. For the low-density n -hexane and the high-density dichloromethane, a peristaltic pump connected to the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was used to drive the oil/water separation. And a self-designed device with aerogel as an intermediate filter layer was used to separate oil and water under the action of gravity. The separation efficiencies ( Eff, %) were

calculated according to the following Eq. (2).

where m$_{i }$ (g) is the oil content before the separation treatment, and m$_{r }$ (g) is the mass of oil remaining after separation. Additionally, the recycling performance is a critical factor in evaluating the practical applicability of oil/water separation materials. To test the recycling ability of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, a continuous cycle oil/water separation experiment was conducted using n -hexane/water and dichloromethane/water mixtures. The separation efficiency of each cycle was calculated.

## 2.5. Multi-class emerging pollutants adsorption experiments

For the adsorption kinetic experiments, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel (1 × 1 × 1 cm) was immersed in a 10 mL solution containing 10 mg/L of MPs, in a shaking bed maintained at 298 K. Samples were collected at regular intervals of time (1, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 60 min). To explore the pH effect, the solution pH was adjusted within the range of 2.0 -12.0 by using 0.1 mol L$^{-1 }$HCl or NaOH. For the adsorption isotherm studies, a series of MPs solutions with initial concentrations ranging from 5 to 600 mg/L were prepared and tested at 298 K. The remaining MPs in the suspension were quantified using a fluorescence spectrophotometer, with the excitation wavelength set at 470 nm and the emission wavelength at 535 nm.

In a study assessing the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel ' s efficiency in removing various emerging pollutants, we examined its performance with levofloxacin, tetracycline, dimethylphthalate, Congo red, Methyl orange, Rhodamine B, and Methylene blue, each at a standard concentration of 10 mg/L.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Optimization of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel

To achieve the best PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, how CZIF-67 loading and hydrophobic materials affected the adsorption properties and wetting behavior were investigated. As depicted in Fig. 1, CZIF-67 could be loaded evenly in CZIF-67/CS aerogel with a doping amount of 10 %, effectively preempting reduced adsorption efficiency owing to adsorption site accumulation. However, elevating the CZIF-67 content to 20 % leads to agglomeration, which reduces the number of available adsorption sites and lowers surface roughness. This change adversely

affects the hydrophobicity, resulting in diminished adsorption efficiency. Additionally, the mechanical integrity of the 20CZIF-67/CS aerogel is compromised, posing challenges in its fabrication process. Consequently, an optimal CZIF-67 loading of 10 % was identified, and the 10CZIF-67/CS aerogel was chosen for subsequent experimental studies. Furthermore, various hydrophobic materials such as LA, SA,

PFOTS, and PDMS were also investigated. As depicted in Fig. 1, the PDMS-modified aerogel demonstrated the highest adsorption efficiency at 97 %, coupled with a water contact angle (WCA) of 151.7 · , classifying it as superhydrophobic. This enhancement in surface roughness conferred a superhydrophobic nature to the aerogel, advantageous for hydrophobic interactions with MPs. The PDMS chains, abundant in

methyl groups, display a significant affinity for MPs [28,29]. Consequently, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was chosen as the optimal superhydrophobic material for the following studies.

## 3.2. Preparation and characterization of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel

The process for preparing PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel is illustrated in Fig. 2 (a). Herein, a superhydrophobic magnetic PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, was fabricated by applying dip-coating and freeze-drying techniques. The aerogel comprises commercial CS substrate, magnetic and photothermal CZIF-67, and low surface-energy PDMS. The homogenized CZIF-67/CS dispersion was poured into a mold (1 × 1 × 1 cm) and transferred to a freezer, which induces an extreme temperature gradient, facilitating swift growth of ice crystals in multiple directions. Consequently, CZIF-67/CS grew on the ice crystals and formed a stable cellular network. Subsequently, a standard freeze-drying process was executed to eliminate the ice crystals and create an initial structure of honeycomb-like aerogel interlaced with CZIF-67 and CS. For optimal superhydrophobic properties, PDMS was deposited on the CZIF-67/CS aerogel via an facile dip-coating technique and then the treated aerogel was cured at 120 ℃ for 2 h.

The pristine CS aerogel exhibits a highly interconnected porous network (Fig. 2(b$_{1}$)), providing a multitude of active adsorption sites. The aerogel ' s surface is smooth (Fig. 2(b$_{2}$)), featuring hydrophilic amino and hydroxyl groups, which contribute to its strong hydrophilicity. In contrast, the CZIF-67/CS aerogel displays an uneven distribution of CZIF-67 aggregates on its surface (Fig. 2(c$_{1}$)), which significantly lowers the surface energy and enhances the material ' s roughness, leading to a transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behavior. Moreover, while the pure CS aerogel lacks magnetic properties, the integration of CZIF-67 introduces notable magnetic characteristics (Video S1). The inset of Fig. 2(c$_{2}$) reveals the crystal structure of CZIF-67 in the aerogel, characterized by a uniform dodecahedron rhomboid geometry [25]. Subsequent PDMS treatment led to the formation of a PDMS layer around CZIF-67, resulting in an unevenly rough structure similar to a thin film (Fig. 2(d)). This led to an improved agglomeration of CZIF-67.

The XRD patterns of CS aerogel, CZIF-67/CS aerogel, and PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was presented in Fig. 3(a). The crystallization characteristics of CS aerogel exhibited two broad peaks at 10.3 · and 19.8 · , respectively. These were due to the hydrogen bond formation through the interaction between the amino and hydroxyl groups of CS [31]. The typical peaks of the synthesized CZIF-67 were observed at 2 θ = 44.24 · , 51.52 · , and 75.74 · , which aligned with the ZIF-67 peaks as reported in the literature [25,26]. The clearly identifiable CZIF-67 peak present in the CZIF-67/CS aerogel spectrum indicated the presence of complete crystal structure within the CZIF-67/CS aerogel. In addition, CZIF-67 doping led to the creation of a more relaxed structure, which was advantageous for MPs to reach the adsorption site of PDMS@CZIF67/CS aerogel. Moreover, the crystalline structure of PDMS@CZIF-67/ CS aerogel remained largely unaffected following hydrophobic modification. Consequently, the XRD outcomes established the successful preparation of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel.

Additionally, the aerogel experienced a transformation to superhydrophobicity from its initial hydrophobic state. Notably, the application of PDMS did not compromise the light absorption capabilities of the aerogel, owing to the inherent transparency of PDMS [30]. Consequently, the aerogel maintains its distinctive black color. The EDS mapping spectra in Fig. 2(e) illustrate the significant presence of Si, Co, O, C, and N in the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel. In addition, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was ultra-light, and able to be placed on relatively light substrates, such as flower cores and pine branches, without any deformation, as depicted in Fig. 2(f). Furthermore, the method used to fabricate this material was both effortless and manageable, allowing for PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel to be expertly designed and fabricated with desirable shapes for various applications, such as cubes and other complex 3D shapes (Fig. 2(g)).

To verify the functional group composition and hydrophobic modification of the adsorbents, FTIR and XPS spectra have been analyzed. In the FTIR spectra (Fig. 3(b)), the peak for CZIF-67 was mainly ascribed to the methyl group of the ligand [32]. The peak ranging between 600 and 1500 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$was attributed to the stretching vibration of the imidazole ring in ZIF-67 [33]. Characteristic peaks of CS aerogel can be seen at

3340 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$( -OH), 1594 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$(C = C), 1037 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$(C -O) and 617 cm GLYPH<0> 1 ( -NH$_{2}$) [34]. The CZIF-67/CS aerogel exhibited characteristic peaks of CS and CZIF-67, indicating the presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups. This suggests that a higher number of adsorption sites may be available. Following superhydrophobic modification, the samples displayed four broad peaks at 802 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 1091 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 1260 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 2967 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. It was determined that these peaks corresponded to the Si-C stretching vibration, Si-O-Si stretching vibration, Si-CH$_{3 }$ stretching vibration and C -H asymmetric stretching vibration, respectively [35,36], demonstrating the successful deposition of PDMS on the samples. The XPS spectra revealed that the samples are mainly composed of C, N, O and Si atoms (Fig. 3(c)). The peaks for Si 2s (151 eV) and Si 2p (102 eV) were detected, corresponding to the Si-O and Si-C bonds, respectively, confirming the success of PDMS modification [35]. PDMS, comprising siloxane and methyl groups, undergoes hydrolysis to produce silanol groups. These groups then participate in a dehydration condensation reaction with the aerogel ' s surface hydroxyl groups, resulting in the formation of Si-O bonds from Si-OH bonds. Furthermore, the strong adhesive properties of PDMS and its curing agent allow for deposition onto the aerogel via physical adhesion, establishing both chemical and physical interfacial interactions between PDMS and the aerogel [28,29]. Fig. 3(d) presents the deconvolution of the N 1s peaks of PDMS@CZIF67/CS aerogel was deconvoluted into four peaks at 398.3, 399.4, 398.8, and 401.0 eV, which are assigned to N -C, N -H, pyridinic N, and -NH$_{2}$, respectively. The presence of abundant nitrogen-containing functional groups in PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was verified by these peaks, which could potentially interact with MPs through π -π stacking interactions [24]. The high-resolution C 1s peaks of aerogel, depicted in Fig. 3(e), consist of three distinctive peaks located at 284.7, 286.8, and 288.6 eV, corresponding to the C -C, C-N, and C = O bonds, respectively.

Fig. 3(f) shows that the O 1s peaks of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel comprised three peaks, positioned at 531.18, 531.98, and 532.88 eV, corresponding to the C = O, C -O -C, and C-OH bonds, respectively[24]. The successful synthesis of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was further confirmed by the XPS results.

## 3.3. Wettability of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel

The surface wettability of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel has been summarized in Fig. 4. As demonstrated in Fig. 4(a), the color of the aerogel turned entirely black from white, and its hydrophobicity was boosted after the addition of PDMS and CZIF-67. As shown in Fig. 4(b), when a droplet of water (dyed in blue) was placed on the surface of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS, it retained a stable spherical shape. Furthermore, Fig. 4(b) displays an optical photograph of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, highlighting its superhydrophobicity with a WCA of 151.7 · . This property is consistent throughout the aerogel, with the interior exhibiting pronounced superhydrophobic characteristics (Fig. 4(c)). As depicted in Fig. 4(d), other common water-based liquids (fruit tea, black tea, coffee, milk) commonly found in everyday life do not infiltrate the interior of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel but can persist on its exterior. The superhydrophobicity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel is attributable to the surface ' s hydrophobic methyl functional groups after modification [35]. When PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was submerged in water, it caused an abundance of air bubbles to appear around the surface, resulting in a mirror reflection phenomenon (Fig. 4(e) & Video S2). More intuitively, when a piece of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was immersed in the water (dyed in blue), no coloured residue was left on the surface (Fig. 4(f) & Video S3). The PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel also exhibited significant repellency towards impinging water flow (Fig. 4(g)

Fig. 4. (a) Photographs of CS aerogel and PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel in water. (b) Photographs of water droplets on the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel. (c) The photo of water droplets inside the aerogel.

& Video S4). When the water droplet came into contact with the surface of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel on the needle and descends, rather than being absorbed, the droplet ' s shape changed, and there was no clear deformation during separation. This indicated an extremely low water adhesion with the surface (Fig. S1). Furthermore, the aerogel exhibited excellent self-cleaning performance. The hydrophilic SiO$_{2 }$ nanoparticles scattered on the inclined surface of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel were carried away by continuous water droplets, resulting in a clean surface (Fig. 4(h)). These phenomena confirmed the excellent superhydrophobicity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel.

## 3.4. Stability of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel

Mechanical durability and chemical stability are essential for the practical application of superhydrophobic materials, particularly for their enduring reuse and operational adaptability. To assess these properties, the coated aerogel underwent a series of experiments. Fig. 5 (a) demonstrates the aerogel ' s robust mechanical strength, as it can endure external forces without sustaining damage. Moreover, its elasticity is evidenced by the minimal deformation that reverts upon compression. After enduring 30 cycles of abrasion testing, the WCA of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel remained above 143 · (Fig. 5(b)), showcasing the strong adhesion of the PDMS and CZIF-67 coatings to the aerogel substrate. Furthermore, PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel maintained its superhydrophobicity and water resistance when subjected to various severe environments, demonstration exceptional chemical stability (Fig. 5(c)). Therefore, PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel has wide application prospects in wastewater treatment.

## 3.5. Oil absorption behaviors of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel

The prepared PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel exhibited superhydrophobic and superoleophilic features, making it suitable for selective oil absorption in oil/water separation, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. The selective oil absorption capacity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was evaluated using a low-density oil model (n-hexane dyed with Sudan III) and a high-density oil model (dichloromethane dyed with Sudan III). As shown in Fig. 6(a) & Video S5, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel has the ability to selectively absorb n-hexane (dyed with Sudan III) on the oil/

water interface. The PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was able to completely remove n -hexane from the water within a few seconds, leaving no traces of water. In contrast, when the aerogel was immersed in water and came into contact with dichloromethane sinking to the bottom of the water, it was able to quickly absorb oil from the water (Fig. 6(b) & Video S6). The study demonstrated that PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel exhibited good performance in the removal of oil spills and organic solvent leakage.

Additionally, the favorable photo thermal conversion performance played a pivotal role in creating a self-heating adsorbent that facilitated the flow of viscous oil and expedited oil absorption. Fig. 6(d) illustrated the infiltration of viscous peanut oil on the surface of the PDMS@CZIF67/CS aerogel, under varying levels of simulated sunlight irradiation. When there was no simulated sunlight irradiation, it took around 10 s for the oil droplet to become fully absorbed. However, with just one simulated sunlight radiation, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was able to fully absorb the same oil droplet within just 3 s (Fig. 6(d) & Video S8), indicating an increase in the penetration rate by nearly 3 times. Furthermore, the viscous oil demonstrated a low-temperature response when exposed to sunlight [38], suggesting that the oil was heated in situ

To assess the absorption capacity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, various typical organic solvents and oils, including engine oil, peanut oil, olive oil, n-hexane, N,N-dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate were tested. The aerogel exhibited an absorption capacity of between 4,000 and 10,000 mg g GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$for the specified oils and solvents, with peanut oil absorption reaching ten times of its own weight. The difference in oil absorption capacity depended on the density and viscosity of the absorbed organic solvent and oil, as shown in Fig. 6(c)[37]. The remarkable absorptive capacity of PDMS@CZIF-67/ CS aerogel may be attributed to its large pore structure, low density, superhydrophobicity, and potent capillary effect. It exhibited robust absorption capacity and exceptional oil absorbency, implying its potential as an oil absorbent. Furthermore, the ability to recycle the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel is of great significance for practical purposes. Hence, an assessment was conducted to determine the recovery ability of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel for oils and organic solvents (Fig. 6(c)). Following 12 cycles of absorption and desorption, the absorption capacity remained substantially unchanged. This exceptional recyclability can be attributed to the PDMS ' s chemical durability, porous structure, and robust hierarchical roughness.

through the collection of solar energy by the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel. The PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel ' s rapid photothermal conversion is primarily due to the inclusion of CZIF-67, a carbon-based material known for its high thermal conductivity via lattice atom vibrations. Additionally, nitrogen doping induces a Fermi energy level shift towards the conduction band within the carbon framework, enhancing both phonon transfer and thermal conductivity [39]. As a result, the aerogel ' s swift light absorption, coupled with efficient heat dissipation, causes a rapid increase in surface temperature. This temperature elevation enhances the fluidity of nearby viscous oils, thus accelerating the absorption of high-viscosity oils. The findings provide additional confirmation that the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel exhibits outstanding oleophilic properties and exceptional self-heating performance.

predetermined contaminated area using an external magnetic field. Fig. 6(e) illustrated the spiral trajectory of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel obtained under the influence of magnetism. In addition, Fig. 6 (e) & Video S9 portrayed an optical image of the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel demonstrating spiral movement. Under precise magnetic control, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel exhibited swift oil absorption on the water surface by completing a spiral trajectory, thereby confirming its magnetic response under high-accuracy magnetic control.

## 3.6. Oil/water separation ability

The filtration-based selective absorption of oil is critical for the effective use of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel. Fig. 7 depicted the continuous gravity-driven process for oil/water separation by the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel. To create a mixture (1:1, v/v), n-hexane

The CZIF-67 deposition allowed for simple separation and manipulation of the aerogel ' s movement atop water[40], directing it toward a

and dichloromethane were initially dyed with Sudan III, then joined with water (dyed using methylene blue). Lastly, the n-hexane/water (Fig. 7(a)) and dichloromethane/water mixtures (Fig. 7(c)) were poured through the funnel. Upon contact with the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, n -hexane and dichloromethane are rapidly absorbed, forming an oil film that significantly diminishes the contact area between water and the aerogel, thereby facilitating water separation. As the aerogel approaches its absorption limit, n-hexane and dichloromethane (red) progressively pour into the beaker, while water (blue) remains in the funnel. After leaving the separated funnel for 5 min, there was no observed seepage of water out of the aerogel. The PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel demonstrates exceptional oil/water separation ability, with separation efficiencies of 99.57 % for n -hexane/water mixture and 99.32 % for dichloromethane/ water mixture, respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 7(b & d) displays the durability of this performance, with the separation efficiency consistently being 96.86 % and 97.32 %, respectively, over the course of 10 filtering experiments.

## 3.7. Removal of MPs

## 3.7.1. Effect of pH

The pH level significantly impacts the process of MPs removal by affecting the surface charge of adsorbent and the MPs present in the solution [41]. Hence, the impact of pH on the removal of MPs was studied within the pH range of 2 -12, and the results are depicted in Fig. 8(a & b). It was observed that the maximum removal efficiency of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel towards MPs was achieved at pH 8, and it decreased gradually as the pH increased. As hydroxide ions in solution compete with negatively charged MPs for adsorption sites on PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, electrostatic interaction proves to be an important mechanism for the adsorption of MPs by PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel under alkaline conditions [42]. Hence, pH 8 was selected for further study.

## 3.7.2. Adsorption kinetics

The evaluation of adsorbent performance and understanding of the adsorption process is highly dependent on the measurement of adsorption rate. The aim of this study was to investigate the rate and mechanism of MPs adsorption by PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel. Multiple experimental results were obtained at different time points. The experimental data was fitted using three kinetic models, including pseudofirst-order, pseudo-second-order kinetics, and intra-particle diffusion models. The necessary parameter values were then calculated using equations [21]:

A continuous device for separating oil and water was established, utilizing a peristaltic pump to evaluate its efficiency. With the activation of the peristaltic pump, the oil was successively transported and deposited into a beaker, resulting in an ongoing oil/water extraction process (Fig. S2(a & b)). As indicated in Fig. S2(c & d), both dichloromethane/water and n-hexane/water mixtures possessed consistent and stable efficiencies exceeding 96 % following ten cycles of separation. After separating the oil/water mixture, the aerogel maintained its porous structure and morphology (Fig. S3), indicating excellent stability and durability. This suggests that the aerogel can be used for long-term continuous oil/water separation without any changes to its original properties or structure.

The adsorption time is denoted by t (min), while q$_{t }$ and q$_{e }$ (mg/g) refer to the adsorption capacity at t and equilibrium times respectively. The rate constants for the three kinetic models: k$_{1 }$ (min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), k$_{2 }$ (g mg GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$min) and k$_{id }$ (mg/g min$^{0.5}$), are also specified. Additionally, C denotes the intercept distance.

For the intra-particle diffusion model (Fig. S4(d)), the plots of q$_{t }$ vs. t 0.5 consisted of two straight lines segments, indicating that the adsorption process of MPs by the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel comprised two steps: external surface adsorption and progressive adsorption. Due to the high concentration of MPs in the solution and the considerable number of adsorption sites on the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, Table S1 displays that the aerogel ' s adsorption rates on MPs followed the order of K$_{i1 }$ > K$_{i2}$ . The MPs adsorption by the aerogel was swift during the first stage. However, the intra-particle diffusion rate was significantly reduced during the later stage due to the simultaneous decrease in the MPs concentration and the adsorption sites [44].

As depicted in Fig. S4(a), the adsorption rate of MPs steadily rises during the initial ten-minute interval. With an extended contact time, the adsorption rate notably decelerates and stabilizes at 40 min, reaching an equilibrium state. Fig. S4(b) and (c), along with Table S1, display the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic linear models fitted accordingly. From the kinetic parameters, it is apparent that the R $^{2 }$values (0.9977) for the pseudo-second-order model were higher than the R $^{2 }$values (0.8390) for the pseudo-first-order model. Additionally, the calculated value of q$_{e }$ is closer to the experimental results. Consequently, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel efficiently conforms to the adsorption of MPs using a pseudo-second-order model, confirming that the adsorption process is chemisorption [43].

## 3.7.3. Adsorption isotherms

Two of the most commonly used isotherms in the characterization of solid -liquid adsorption systems are Langmuir and Freundlich. The parameters were determined by fitting values from both models [21]:

where equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacities are represented by q$_{e }$ and q$_{m }$ (mg/g), respectively. The concentration of individual solutions is denoted by C$_{e }$ (mg/L), and the Langmuir constant by k$_{L }$ (L/

The standard curve between MPs concentration and absorbance was constructed. Fig. S5 displayed a correlation coefficient ( R $^{2}$) of 0.99913 for the standard curve, accurately depicting the connection between absorbance and concentration[44]. The MPs adsorption capacity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel for MPs increases with increasing MPs concentration until the adsorption sites on PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel are completely occupied to reach adsorption saturation (Fig. S6(a)). Langmuir and Freundlich sorption isotherm models were implemented to describe the adsorption process of MPs (Fig. S6(b-d)). The data of Table S2 indicates that the Langmuir model has significantly higher correlation coefficient R 2 values than the Freundlich model. Consequently, the Langmuir model is more appropriate for describing this adsorption process. The analysis result indicate that MPs adsorption is a homogeneous process involving a single-molecule layer adsorption [21]. In addition, the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel, fitted by the Langmuir model, was 34.5 mg g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. In addition, the adsorption capacity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel was compared with previously reported results (Table S3). The results show that PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel has good adsorption properties.

## 3.8. Adsorption mechanism

Fig. 9 investigated the mechanism of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel adsorption of MPs and oil. Typically, internal micropores in materials bolster capillarity [45]. Thanks to the abundant porosity of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogels, MPs and different oils are attracted to the inner pores. Moreover, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel can effectively adsorb MPs, as non-covalent bonding forces between the MPs and aerogel exist. MPs contains an abundance of non-polar benzene rings and methyl groups, which confer high surface tension and low surface energy, endowing MPs with hydrophobic characteristics [46]. The PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel and MPs exhibit pronounced hydrophobicity, facilitating the adsorption of MPs onto the aerogel through hydrophobic interactions, in accordance with the " like dissolves like " principle. Additionally, the methyl groups of MPs and PDMS chains have grasping forces, enhancing adsorption [29,46]. The zeta potential analysis (Fig. 8(b)) reveals that the MPs possess a negative charge, while the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel is positively charged, suggesting that electrostatic interaction plays a role in adsorption. Moreover, the MPs ' abundant benzene rings engage in π -π stacking with aromatic components of the aerogel [25,27]. The subtle Van der Waals forces also contribute to the adsorption process [26]. In summary, the principal adsorption mechanisms for negatively charged MPs involve hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic attractions, and π -π stacking.

## 3.9. Removal of other emerging pollutants

To demonstrate the adsorption capability of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel for various pollutants, representative multi-class emerging pollutants were selected, such as antibiotics (levofloxacin, tetracycline), derivatives of MPs (dimethyl phthalate), anionic dyes (Congo red, Methyl orange) and cationic dyes (Rhodamine B, Methylene blue). Each was used at an initial concentration of 10 mg/L in independent adsorption studies, as shown in Fig. 10(a). Additionally, PDMS@CZIF67/CS aerogel exhibits outstanding adsorption performance for a range of diverse emerging pollutants. The adsorption efficiency for seven such contaminants has been extensively evaluated with incredible results. Specifically, the adsorption efficiency of PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel for levofloxacin, tetracycline, dimethylphthalate, Congo red, Methyl orange, Rhodamine B, and Methylene blue was 63.7 %, 85.6 %, 73.8 %, 94.2 %, 94.4 %, 44.9 %, and 50.2 %, respectively. The effective adsorption of levofloxacin and tetracycline by PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel can be attributed to the presence of electrostatic attraction, π -π interaction and hydrogen bonding between them [47]. Furthermore, the similarity in structure between dimethylphthalate and MPs suggests that

PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel can adsorb it through hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic attraction and π -π interaction [5]. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of Congo red and Methyl orange was 94 % owing to the electrostatic attraction between the anionic dye and PDMS@CZIF67/CS aerogel [46]; whereas, the adsorption effect of Rhodamine B and Methylene blue was relatively low, with removal rates of 44.9 % and 50.2 % respectively, due to the electrostatic repulsion between cationic dyes and PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel [3]. As a result, the proposed aerogel has excellent adsorption properties for a wide range of emerging pollutants. To assess the effect of multiple pollutants on adsorption efficiency, co-adsorption experiments were performed using four out of seven selected pollutants: dimethyl phthalate, tetracycline, Congo red, and Methylene blue. The corresponding adsorption efficiencies were measured at 54.2 %, 70.8 %, 81.9 %, and 36.7 %, respectively. These findings suggest that the system still exhibits a significant adsorption capacity despite the competitive adsorption of various pollutants.

The findings outlined above indicate that PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel exhibits outstanding comprehensive performance compared to the traditional superhydrophobic materials documented in Table S4. Not only does this aerogel exhibit outstanding oil/water separation

capabilities, but it also demonstrates a host of other functionalities, such as the adsorption of MPs, antibiotics, microplastic derivatives, anionic dyes, and cationic dyes. In addition, it displays photothermal conversion performance and magnetism, as illustrated in Fig. 10(b).

## 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a multifunctional superhydrophobic PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel using the freeze-drying and dip-coating technique for the first time. The aerogel efficiently separates oil/ water mixtures and has a high oil absorption capacity (4,000 -10,000 mg/g) for various kinds of oils. Moreover, the aerogel demonstrates exceptional self-cleaning ability and stability, retaining over 90 % of its initial absorption capacity and shows excellent oil separation efficiency (over 96 %) even after 10 cycles of separation. Due to its magnetic-responsive properties and photothermal conversion capabilities, the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel autonomously absorbs oil under magnetic control, enabling its effective deployment in the treatment of high-viscosity oils and facilitating separation and recovery process. Meanwhile, continuous oil/water separation was achieved through gravity or with the assistance of a peristaltic pump. In addition, various kinds of emerging pollutants, especially MPs, were efficiently captured from the aqueous solution using the PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel. As a result, the sustainable PDMS@CZIF-67/CS aerogel is considered an appealing option for large-scale purification of wastewater.
