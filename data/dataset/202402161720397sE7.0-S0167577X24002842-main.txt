## 1. Introduction

The development of highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for accelerated urea kinetics and a reduced energy barrier is deemed imperative, urgently desired to facilitate widespread adoption.[1] An energetic advantage is exhibited by the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), boasting a low thermodynamic equilibrium potential (0.37 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), notably lower than the conventional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 1.23 V. This results in a remarkable 70% theoretical energy saving, positioning it as a promising alternative to the OER for sustainable hydrogen generation.[2-4] Additionally, attention has been garnered by urea fuel cells (UFCs) as sustainable energy storage and conversion devices, with high gravimetric energy density (3000 Wh kg-1), cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, despite these merits, challenges observed in urea electrocatalysis are faced by practical UFCs. These challenges arise from the intrinsic sluggish electrochemical kinetics of UOR, involving a 6-electron-proton coupled transfer process and complex kinetics of intermediates adsorption-desorption, compounded by stability concerns related to catalysts.[5,6] Efforts have been taken to fabricate efficient urea oxidation catalysts, encompassing both precious and non-precious catalysts.[7] Inspired by urease, low-cost nickel-based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives, with dynamically generated NiOOH on their surface identified as the active site of UOR.[8,9] Building upon insights gained from exploring various urea oxidation catalysts and their characteristics, this study extends the investigation to practical applications.

In this study, heterogeneous Ni oxide/Ni sulfide nanorods (NiO@NiS) were synthesized through a hydrothermal method initiated

from Ni-MOF. The resulting structure at the NiO/NiS interface enhances the catalytic ability of urea oxidation, leading to high selectivity at low potential (below 1.5 V vs. RHE). These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of nickel-based catalyst applications in water splitting [10,11] and urea-rich wastewater treatment.

## 2. Experimental

Synthesis of NiO@NiS catalyst : 0.2 g of NiO from Ni-MOF calcination, 1.25 mmol Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$·6H$_{2}$O, and 3.5 mmol thiourea were added to 60 mL of ultra-pure water in an autoclave. After sonication for 10 min, the sealed autoclave was heated at 200 o C for 18 h. Following the cooling down, washing with water and ethanol, filtration, and vacuum dry, the black NiO@NiS nanorod was provided subsequently. The composition flow diagram for NiO@NiS is shown in Figure 1a.

## 3. Results and Discussion

The morphology of NiO@NiS was depicted by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The calcined NiO spheroidal nanoparticles was loaded on NiS nanorods during the synthesis (Figure 1b&c, Figure S1). Additionally, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images revealed lattice fringes corresponding to the (200) crystal faces of NiO (0.2 nm) and the (131) crystal faces of NiS (0.185 nm), further affirming the successful synthesis of hybrid NiO@NiS structure (Figure 1d). Moreover, the uniform distribution of Ni, O, and S was confirmed by the elemental mapping images (Figure 1e).

The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for NiO and Ni-MOF was illustrated in Figure 2a. The peak at 432.4 cm⁻¹ signified the tensile vibration of Ni-O bond, while peaks between 1662.2-1340.9 cm⁻¹ in Ni-MOF represented asymmetric and symmetrical vibrations of the deprotic form of -COO. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of synthesized Ni-MOF is aligns with the standard sample (Figure 2b). Moreover, the pattern of fabricated NiO@NiS showcased distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.2°, 43.3°, 62.9°, and 75.3°, identical with the synthesized and standard NiO (71-7119), and peaks at 2θ = 18.5°, 30.3°, 32.2°, 35.7°, 40.5°, 49.0°, 50.2°, 52.7°, 56.3°, 57.5°, and 59.7° correspond to the yielding and standard NiS (12-0041) (Figure 2c). Moreover, a

Additionally, the elemental composition and bonding state of NiO@NiS was also examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In full XPS spectrum of NiO@NiS, characteristic peaks correspond to S$_{2p}$, C$_{1s}$, O$_{1s}$, and Ni$_{2p}$ was depicted at 163, 285, 555, and 855 eV, respectively (Figure S2). In Ni$_{2p}$ spectrum, the binding energy at 872.6 eV and 855.3 eV correspond to the Ni$_{2p1/2}$, and Ni$_{2p2/3}$ orbitals of Ni, indicating the existence of Ni 2+ (Figure 2f).[12] The XPS peaks corresponding to the Ni-O bond at 529.4 eV (Figure 2g)[13] and the Ni-S bond at 161.7 eV (Figure 2h)[14] demonstrated the formation of hybrid NiO@NiS structure.

The electrochemical oxidation of urea was initially studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a conventional three-electrode system containing 1 M KOH with a scanning rate of 10 mV s⁻¹ (Figure 3a). The redox peaks corresponding to Ni²⁺/Ni³⁺ redox pairs can be observed by all the catalysts, within which the NiO@NiS displayed the most significant current density, indicating most abundant active catalytic sites. Subsequently, the catalytic performance of NiO@NiS toward urea oxidation was verified by a sharp increase of anode current with the addition of 0.33 M urea (Figure 3b). Comparative analysis in Figure 3c demonstrated the superior UOR activity of NiO@NiS over individual NiO and NiS, suggesting that the heterogeneous interface formed post-composite facilitated the transformation of Ni 2+ to Ni 3+ , thus enhancing catalytic activity. Furthermore, the lower Tafel slope of NiO@NiS (31.78 mV dec⁻¹) than that of NiO (35.28 mV dec⁻¹) and NiS (42.42 mV dec⁻¹) also confirmed accelerated reaction kinetics in urea oxidation (Figure 3d). Additionally, the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) of NiO@NiS electrode was proven by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with the smallest semi-circle radius in the impedance diagram (Figure 3e). Exploration of different urea concentrations from 0.11 mol/L to 0.66 mol/L in 1 M KOH revealed that 0.33 mol/L was the optimal concentration for UOR process (Figure S3). Diminishing efficiency with excess urea may be due to impediment effect of CO$_{2}$ generated from the urea decompose. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the Ni-based catalysts were further evaluated using cyclic

voltammetry (CV) determining the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl). With Cdl values 1.3, 0.5, and 2.3 mF cm⁻² denoted as NiO, NiS, and NiO@NiS, respectively (Figure 3f and S4), the NiO@NiS electrode exhibited larger surface area and fostered more favorable environment for electrolysis than the others. Additionally, the effect of scanning rate through CV revealed that NiO@NiS exhibited superior catalytic kinetics compared to NiO and NiS (Figure S5). Stability testing (Figure S6) indicated stable redox peaks corresponding to Ni²⁺/Ni³⁺ redox pairs throughout CV cycles, demonstrating commendable catalytic stability of NiO@NiS.

The NiO@NiS catalyst demonstrated significant catalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Upon comparison, NiO@NiS exhibited the highest current density (Figure 3g), and the lowest Tafel slope (Figure 3h), indicating its intrinsically superior electrocatalytic properties. Additionally, the Cdl values followed the order 40.9 mF cm -2 (NiO@NiS) > 9.95 mF cm -2 (NiS) > 4.7 mF cm -2 (NiO), demonstrating that NiO@NiS had the most favorable active area (Figure 3i and S7). With these examined catalytic properties, a two-electrode cell equipped with NiO@NiS as both cathode and anode was established (Figure 4a). The enhancement of water splitting was further confirmed by evaluating electrocatalysis with or without urea. At 10 mA cm -2 , the cell voltage decreased by approximately 0.43 V with the aid of urea oxidation, highlighting the efficiency and robustness of NiO@NiS as a bifunctional catalyst in electrochemical urea-assisted hydrogen production (Figure 4b). The indirect oxidation of Ni 2+ in the electrode to Ni 3+ on the Ni-based catalyst surface is the main reason for the high activity of the NiO@NiS electrode (Figure 4c). The electrooxidation performance is comparable to that of the reported nickel-based catalysts. (Table S1-2).

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, the synthesis of hetero-nanorod structures in NiO@NiS from Ni-MOF has been accomplished through a straightforward combination of hydrothermal and pyrolysis methods. This distinctive rod-shaped composite material imparts an augmented electroactive surface area, thereby presenting a greater number of accessible active sites. The observed NiS and NiO interfacial effects contribute significantly to the elevated electrocatalytic performance of NiO@NiS. Notably, the nanorod composite exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction, achieving a notable current density of 10 mA cm -2 at a voltage of 1.44 V (vs. RHE). This performance surpasses that of individual NiO and NiS. The catalyst developed in this work introduces a novel perspective for the treatment of urea-rich domestic wastewater and promising green hydrogen supply.
