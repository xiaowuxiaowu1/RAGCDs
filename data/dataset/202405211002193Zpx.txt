## 1. Introduction

The treatment, utilization and management of agricultural waste biomass is a challenging problem for national development[1], and a large amount of agricultural waste biomass, due to the lack of feasible and effective methods to recycle, causes environmental pollution and air quality deterioration and other problems. In recent years, people have transformed agricultural waste biomass into value-added products that can be used in various life scenes to achieve environmentally friendly green sustainable development economy[1,2]. Extracting natural polymers from agricultural waste biomass[3] or converting them directly into carbon-based materials[4] can be used in the production of functional composite materials, such as new adsorbents, catalyst carriers and energy storage electrode materials[2,5].

Tea residue is a kind of agricultural waste biomass, which is produced in the process of tea planting, processing, storage and consumption[6]. Global tea production and consumption is very large, resulting in the amount of waste tea residue is also increasing year by year[7]. The arbitrary treatment of tea residue not only causes environmental

## ABSTRACT

Surface engineering is an indispensable basic means to improve the properties of carbon nanomaterials and expand their application fields. Herein, tea residue was used as raw material to produce nano-biochar (NBC) by thermal decomposition method. Then the NBC was reshaped in situ on electrode surface to obtain electroreduced NBC (ErNBC) by cyclic voltammetry. After related material characterization, it is found that the properties of NBC are ideally reshaped after in situ electrochemical reduction, the size of NBC is reduced, the content of O element is increased, the hydrophilicity of NBC is enhanced, and the conductivity of NBC is improved. A model was constructed synchronously, and theoretical calculations were conducted to verify the changes in the material ' s energy gap. Meanwhile, utilizing the structural properties of ErNBC, we develop an electrochemical sensor combined with machine learning for selective detection of Pb 2 + in actual water samples with a satisfactory recovery rate.

pollution, but also wastes biological resources. In order to solve this problem, people began to explore the reuse value of tea residue. The carbon content of tea residue accounts for about 50 %, in addition, it is rich in carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino and other functional groups, which can be converted into biochar materials by thermochemical means such as pyrolysis[8]. Nano-biochar (NBC) is an emerging environmentally friendly nanocarbon material. The transformed biochar material has developed pore structure, rich functional groups and large specific surface area, and can be used as an efficient biological adsorbent[8] for adsorbing heavy metals[9], organic pollutants[10,11] and other substances. The use of nanobiologic technology based on agricultural waste to construct " closed-loop agriculture " [12], efficient use of biomass, to achieve the effect of " turning waste into treasure " .

Surface engineering is a necessary basic means to change the properties of carbon nanomaterials and expand their application fields [13 -15]. Carbon nanomaterials with desired properties and specified sizes can be customized by introducing specific functional groups or directionally regulating their structures through different means. However, the controllable tailoring of carbon nanomaterials at the molecular

scale remains a major challenge[16]. High-temperature heat treatment has been a common modification method in the past, but this method reduces the material ' s specific surface area, dispersibility and ability to interact with other substances[17,18]. Moreover, excessive temperatures may cause some materials to over-carbonize, resulting in the loss of energy and raw materials[19,20]. Oxidation modification is also a common modification method, which introduces oxygen-containing functional groups to the surface of carbon nanomaterials under the action of strong oxidants to modify the surface[21]. This method will reduce the electrochemical properties of the material, and the uneven oxidation will also increase the instability of the material, making its modification uncontrollable[22,23]. There is still a lack of a simple and universal modification method to effectively regulate various types of carbon nanomaterials.

Herein, a strategy for cutting nanobiochar (NBC) in situ by electroreduction is proposed (Scheme.1). After electroreduction shear, the material properties are ideally reshaped, including size reduction by four times, electrical conductivity improvement, and hydrophilicity enhancement. At the same time, in sensing applications, the NBC treated by electric reduction is selective to Pb 2 + detection, and the response current of Pb 2 + is also enhanced. Therefore, we developed an electrochemical sensor based on ErNBC combined with machine learning that can selectively detect Pb 2 + in actual water samples. Compared with the traditional method, a satisfactory recovery rate was obtained. This work provides an example for cutting carbon nanomaterials and further expands its application in the detection of heavy metal.

## 2. Experimental section

## 2.1. Materials and Apparatus

Tea residue was obtained from Prof. Zhonghua Liu (National Research Center of Engineering Technology for Utilization of Functional Ingredients from Botanicals, Hunan Agricultural University). Nafion (5 wt%, in a mixture of water and lower aliphatic alcohols) was purchased from Aldrich. KCl, K$_{3}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$], K$_{4}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$], HAc and NaAc were procured from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Buffer solution were 0.2 M HAc-NaAc (ABS) and 0.1 M NaH$_{2}$PO$_{4}$-Na$_{2}$HPO$_{4 }$(PBS) aqueous solution, and the pH was adjusted by using HCl/H$_{3}$PO$_{4 }$ or NaOH. HNO$_{3 }$ is a guaranteed reagent bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China). All other reagents were of analytical grade and used directly without any purification. Double-distilled deionized water was used throughout the experiments.

Electrochemical experiments were conducted on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Co., Ltd., China). A three-electrode system was used for the electrochemical experiments, glassy carbon electrode (GCE, diameter of 3 mm) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and platinum plate as the counter electrode. In this work, all potentials are

referenced to the Ag/AgCl electrode. Centrifugal tubes for material preparation (3031000 SAINING). The structure and elemental analysis of NBC and ErNBC were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-3010, Jeol, Japan) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). UV -vis spectra and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a UV-2450 spectrophotometer and Nicolet Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrophotometer, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on A K-Alpha + instrument with Al K α radiation (Thermo Scientific, USA). pH adjustment is carried out by the pHS-3E pH meter (Shanghai Precision Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.). The actual sample comparison test was performed by the iCAP7200 HS (Thermo Scientific,USA) and commercial gold film electrode (Changsha Sunjun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.) through PalmSens4 electrochemical workstation (Red Matrix China Limited.). The morphology of Pb 2 + at different pH was fitted by Visual MINTEQ 3.1. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap of NBC and ErNBC were calculated by the pm6 semi-empirical method of Gaussian 09 W[24]. The electrostatic potential and HOMO-LUMO of Pb 2 + are calculated at the B3LYP/ Lan2DZ level of Gauss 09 W.

## 2.2. Preparation of NBC

Briefly (Fig. 1), wash tea residue, then dry it in an oven at 60 · C for 48 h to obtain dry tea residue. 2 g of grinded tea residue was put into a quartz boat. Then the temperature was raised to.

300 · C at 2 · C/min and kept for 2 h in the tube furnace under atmosphere of nitrogen. After naturally cooled to room temperature, the black powder was transferred into a beaker and added 50 mL deionized water to stirred for 24 h. In order to obtain uniform size particles, the purification and synthesis process of carbon nanomaterial-carbon dots is used for reference. A brown solution was obtained by filtering with a 0.22 μ m filtration membrane and was purified via dialysis (3500 Da) for 24 h. Finally, NBC powder was obtained by freeze-drying, and stored at 4 · C for later application. The obtained powder was prepared into 1.25 mg/L NBC solution with deionized water, and then the uniformly dispersed solution was obtained by ultrasound for 5 -10 min.

## 2.3. Preparation of ErNBC modified GCE

The GCE was carefully treated and cleaned according to our previous methods[25,26], polishing, ultrasound, electrochemical treatment, CV characterization ( Δ E$_{p }$ < 100 mV), See supplementary material (Fig. S1ad) for detailed operation steps. 5 μ L NBC solution (1.25 mg/L) and 1 μ L Nafion solution (0.05 wt%) was sequentially dripped-dry onto the GCE to obtain the Nafion/NBC/GCE (Fig. S2a). Nafion can prevent NBC materials from falling off during in-situ CV reshaping and Pb 2 + detection processes. Nafion/ErNBC/GCE (Fig. S2b) was obtained by one cycle (60 s) of CV scanning of Nafion/NBC/GCE at the potential of GLYPH<0> 1.5 to 0 V (Scanning direction: positive) in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 5), the scan rate was

50 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$(Scheme 1).

## 2.4. Electrochemical measurements

Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) measurements were carried out in 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH = 6.0). The test procedure mainly consisted of three steps (Fig. S2c) [27]: Preconcentration (step 1), under magnetic stirring conditions, the fabricated Nafion/ErNBC/GCE was immersed into 0.2 M acetate buffer containing metal ions to accumulate and reduce metal ions into metals under preconcentration potential of GLYPH<0> 1.20 V. The preconcentration time was 6 min. The possible REDOX reactions on the electrodes in this step are as follows. Nafion/ErNBC/GCE + Pb 2 + (from solution) + 2e$^{- $_{→ }$}$Nafion/ ErNBC/GCE-Pb$^{0 }$(surface). Stripping (step 2), the metals were stripped

off using DPASV potential scan from GLYPH<0> 1.0 V to GLYPH<0> 0.2 V with no magnetic stirring. This step reaction is as follows: Nafion/ErNBC/GCE-Pb$^{0 }$(surface) → Nafion/ErNBC/GCE (surface) + Pb 2 + (into solution) + 2e$^{-}$. Cleaning (step 3), the modified electrode was cleaned for 80 s at GLYPH<0> 0.2 V under stirring conditions to remove the previous residual metals from electrode surface for next measurement.

## 2.5. Treatment of water sample

Two water samples were prepared, one was river water (Liuyang river, Changsha, China) and the other was farmland water (Yunyuan, Changsha, China). First of all, the water samples determined by electrochemical method are centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min to remove insoluble small particles. Then the supernatant was filtered through

0.45 μ M inorganic filter membrane, and finally diluted with 0.2 M acetic acid buffer solution (pH = 6.0) for measurement. The water samples determined by ICP method are centrifuged and then filtered as above, but the difference is that the sample should be nitrated. The filtered solution was acidified with purified nitric acid to pH < 2 and sealed at 4 · C.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Characterization of materials

As shown in Fig. 2, morphology, size, and elemental composition analysis were performed on the prepared NBC and ErNBC. the TEM images of NBC (Fig. 2a) and ErNBC (Fig. 2d) exhibit uniform circular nanoparticles with diameters of 8.19 nm ± 1.38 nm and 2.19 ± 0.42 nm, respectively. The size of the NBC after CV is about one-fourth that of the NBC before CV. Interestingly, the diameter of ErNBC changes obviously compared with NBC, it can be attributed to CV which has a tailoring effect on the NBC. Similar phenomenon had also been reported for Neem graphene quantum dots prepared by hydrothermal method [28]. Fig. 2b and 2e exhibit the HRTEM images of NBC and ErNBC, respectively. There is no clear lattice fringe observed from the HRTEM images, indicating low carbonization degree and poor crystallization of NBC and ErNBC, because of the NBC and ErNBC contain larger amount of oxygen with lower content of carbon [29,30]. The EDS results (Fig. 2c and 2f) confirm that NBC and ErNBC are consist of C, O, N elements, the presence of Si and Cu elements is due to the substrate (load) used for electron microscopy.

More insights of chemical valence state and elemental composition of NBC and ErNBC were examined via XPS, as shown in Fig. 3. From the XPS full-scan survey of NBC and ErNBC (Fig. 3a and 3e), C, O, N elements can be detected on the surface of NBC and ErNBC, which are also consistent with the results of EDS (Fig. 2c and 2f). The elements content

of NBC and ErNBC were also examined (Table S1), after CV of NBC, the content of C and N elements decrease, but the content of O element increases. It meant that the functional group on NBC surface has been successfully regulated by CV. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3e show C1s peak (284.8 eV), O1s peak (531.23 eV) and N1s peak (399.3 eV)[31] of NBC and ErNBC, respectively. The high resolution C1s XPS spectra of NBC (Fig. 3b) confirms the presence of C -C (284.1 eV), C-N (285.3 eV), C-O (287.2 eV), C = O (288.2 eV) on the surface of NBC. The high resolution C1s XPS spectra of ErNBC (Fig. 3f) confirms the presence of C = C (284.6 eV), C-N (285.3 eV), C-O (287.8 eV) on the surface of ErNBC. Fig. 3d and 3 h show that the -NO$_{2 }$(405.7 eV) and -C ≡ N (397.1 eV) disappear after CV of NBC. Compared with the change of high resolution O1s XPS spectra (Fig. 3c and 3 g), the form and content of oxygen-containing functional groups obviously improve [30,32,33].

Furthermore, in order to find the internal relationship between properties of ErNBC and improved sensitivity of ErNBC for detection of Pb 2 + , FT-IR and contact angle measurement were used to complementarily examine the properties of composite. FT-IR spectra of NBC and ErNBC are shown in Fig. 3j. It was not difficult to find that NBC and ErNBC exhibit characteristic absorption bands of -OH stretching vibrations at 3433 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, C -H stretching vibrations at 2985 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, C = O stretching vibrations at 1655 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in the COOH, C -O stretching vibrations at 1327 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, and C -N stretching vibrations at 1418 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which is consistent with the XPS results[28,33]. The related results exhibit the existence of -OH, -COOH groups on the surface of ErNBC. These groups can play as anchor sites to capture more target Pb 2 + on ErNBC surface to

Further exploring the functional groups of NBC and ErNBC, UV -vis absorption spectra of NBC (Fig. 3i) exhibits three characteristic absorption peaks at 250 nm, 271 nm and 315 nm, owing to π-π * transition of graphite sp$^{2 }$domain, n GLYPH<0> π * transition of C = O and n GLYPH<0> π of conjugated C = N bonds in the doped NBC, respectively[32,34]. And C = N (315 nm) disappears after CV of NBC, which is also consistent with the results of XPS.

improve the Pb 2 + -analysis performance[35] (Fig. 3n). According to the above structure characterization, the possible structure diagram of electrochemical sheared NBC is drawn (Fig. 3m). Fig. 3k and 3i shows the wetting characteristics of NBC and ErNBC, and the contact angles are 92.5 · and 85.6 · , respectively. ErNBC have smaller contact angles and stronger wettability, which can be attributed to more oxygen-containing functional groups after NBC electrochemical reshaping (Table S1) and stronger hydrophilicity, consistent with the results of XPS. In addition, as shown in Fig. S3a, peaks emerge at 1348.45 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 1585.39 cm GLYPH<0> 1 after pyrolysis of tea residue, which belong to the D-peak and G-peak of Raman characteristics of C atom, indicating the successful synthesis of nano-biochar carbon materials. The XRD (Fig. S3b) pattern shows that after NBC reduction, the peak strength of graphite (002) corresponding to 27.8 · is significantly weakened[36], which is consistent with the conclusion that the previous reduction reduces the remodeling of graphite crystals in NBC, resulting in a significant reduction in peak strength.

Electrochemical characterization is a good way to understand the relationship between performance and detection effect for NBC and ErNBC[37]. As shown in Fig. 4a-b, the exposed GCE has excellent electrical conductivity. After modifying GCE with NBC, the peak current of Nafion/NBC/GCE decreases significantly. However, compared with Nafion/NBC/GCE, the peak current of Nafion/ErNBC/GCE is significantly larger. In addition, the material is tested for EIS. Fig. 4c is a Nyquist diagram showing the correlation of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance with frequency. Fig. 4d is a Bode diagram showing the relationship between impedance and phase Angle. As can be seen from the figure, the impedance of Nafion/ErNBC/GCE is smaller than that of Nafion/NBC/GCE. It was consistent with the analysis of CV results. It is speculated that conductive ErNBC can restore the electrode activity to a certain extent, which leads to the increase of peak current and the decrease of interface resistance. These results prove that the NBC are reduced in the CV process. And the conductive ErNBC is conducive to the improvement of Pb 2 + -analysis performance. Based on CV data, the active specific surface area of the Nafion/NBC/GCE and Nafion/ErNBC/ GCE was further investigated. The linear relationship between the peak current ( I$_{p}$ ) of different electrodes and the square root of the scan rate ( v $^{1/2}$) in 5.0 mM [Fe(CN)$_{6 }$ ] 3 GLYPH<0> /4 GLYPH<0> solution containing 0.1 M KCl at different scan rate ( v , from 40 to 280 mV · s $^{-1}$) is shown in Fig. 4f and 4 h.

The Randles -Sevcik formula, eq (1), is used to calculate the active specific surface area of the Nafion/NBC/GCE and Nafion/ErNBC/GCE [25,39].

where n is the number of transfer-electron, A (cm$^{2}$) is the active specific surface area, D (cm$^{2$_{·}$}$s $^{-1}$) is related to the diffusion coefficient, v (V · s $^{-1}$) is the scan rate, and C$_{0 }$ (mol · cm $^{-3}$) is the concentration of [Fe(CN)$_{6}$] 3 GLYPH<0> /4 GLYPH<0> . When the electrolyte solution is the 5 mM [Fe(CN)$_{6}$] 3 GLYPH<0> /4 GLYPH<0> solution containing 0.1 M KCl, n = 1, and D = 7.30 × 10$^{-6 }$(cm$^{2$_{·}$}$s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$)[40], then, it can be calculated from eq (1) that A of Nafion/NBC/GCE is 0.154 mm$^{2}$, A of Nafion/ErNBC/GCE is 0.245 mm$^{2}$, respectively (Fig. 5f and 5 h). Because ErNBC nanoparticles will decrease in size after CV of NBC, which is confirmed by the TEM results (Fig. 2).

In order to elucidate the possible mechanism of NBC sheared by CV electoreduction, a theoretical calculation method was adopted. The geometric structure, HOMO-LUMO energy gap before and after NBC reduction were simulated. As shown in Fig. 5a, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of ErNBC is larger than that of NBC, indicating that the reduction reaction of NBC requires more energy and is more difficult to carry out. In order to confirm the accuracy of this conclusion, cyclic voltammetry was used to measure and calculate the energy gap of the material. Fig. S4 shows the cyclic voltammetry curves of NBC and ErNBC in acetonitrile solution containing 0.2 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorphosphate with 5 mg ferrocene as the internal standard. According to previous literature reports, it is calculated that E$_{g }$$_{(NBC) }$ = 2.41 eV, E$_{g }$$_{(ErNBC) }$ = 2.71 eV, both are different from theoretically calculated results. Since the nanobiochar model used in the theoretical calculation is simulated based on the structural characterization, and the structure of is nanobiochar not precise, so the error with the actual experiment is understandable. However, the experimental results are consistent with the deduced rule of theoretical calculation, also indicating that the reduction reaction of NBC requires more energy and is more difficult to carry out. Combined with images of CV elecroreduction of NBC (Fig. 5b, 5c and 5d), the reduction peak from the second circle to the fifth circle moves to a more negative potential than that of the first circle, which further indicates that after ErNBC is generated by the first circle reduction, subsequent re-reduction is difficult, and only a small amount of NBC can be re-restored. In order to explore the optimal number of

Plot of peak current varies with the square root of different scan rates at Nafion/NBC/GCE (f) and Nafion/ErNBC/GCE (h), respectively.

(g) DPASV of Nafion/ErNBC/GCE at different cycles in a 0.2 M HAc-NaAc buffer containing 1 mg/L Pb 2 + .

cycles for ErNBC preparation by CV method, the following experiments were carried out. First, as shown in Fig. 5c, the first cycle of scanning has a significant cathode current at GLYPH<0> 0.3 V, producing a reduction peak at GLYPH<0> 0.54 V. With the increase of the number of cycles, the peak value of displacement appears, and the peak value gradually decreases. It is speculated that the reason for this phenomenon may be that the role of the first circle of CV is to first tailor the NBC and then reduce them. The second to fifth cycles are dominated by CV of NBC. When the NBC is clipped, its surface functional groups and defects will increase, resulting in an increase in the reduction peak current. With the increase of the number of reduction cycles, the defects decrease and the functional groups are gradually reduced, resulting in the displacement and gradual reduction of the reduction peak potential. The edge unstable bonds, surface functional groups and defects of NBC structure are conducive to increase the adsorption of lead ions at active sites. However, increasing the number of reduction cycles will reduce the detection effect, so we believe that the optimal number of cycles is one cycle. In stripping measurement, the cycle of potential scanning of NBC deeply effects the performance of modified electrode for Pb 2 + detection. Therefore, the cycle number of electrochemical reshaping of NBC was optimized. In Fig. 5g, Pb 2 + has the highest DPASV peak current in one cycle. In addition, CV (Fig. 5e) and EIS (Fig. 5f) experiments were conducted for ErNBC prepared with different reduction cycles, and it can be seen from

the results that the electrochemical response value is the best when the reduction cycle number is one cycle. Therefore, it can be concluded that the best number of cycle for ErNBC preparation is one cycle.

## 4. Selective determination of Pb 2 þ

Response surface methodology was used to optimize the experimental conditions for Pb 2 + detection on Nafion/ErNBC/GCE in 0.2 M HAc-NaAc buffer solution containing 1 mg/L Pb 2 + (Fig. 6). The best conditions were obtained by optimization. To examine the dependence of stripping peak currents for Pb 2 + on deposition time, the deposition time was optimized from 180 s to 480 s (Fig. 6a). The response of DPASV peak current enhances with the increase of deposition time varying from 180 s to 480 s, and it increases slowly from 360 s to 480 s. It can be owing to the amount of Pb 2 + on the modified electrode surface increases with extension of the deposition time. However, along with the deposition time increases, the saturated concentration of Pb 2 + on the modified electrode surface will lead to the decrease of sensitivity and upper detection limit instead[41]. So, 360 s was chosen as the deposition time. The deposition potential was optimized from GLYPH<0> 1.00 V to GLYPH<0> 1.20 V. As shown in Fig. 6b, the DPASV peak currents of Pb 2 + increase with the increase of deposition potential from GLYPH<0> 1.00 V to GLYPH<0> 1.20 V, but when more negative potential exceeds GLYPH<0> 1.20 V, H$_{2 }$ will generate on the

modified electrode surface and interfere with the analysis[42]. Therefore, GLYPH<0> 1.20 V was selected as the deposition potential. The pH range of 3.0 -6.0 in 0.2 M HAc-NaAc was optimized to examine the influence of acidity of the accumulation solution on analysis of Pb 2 + , as shown in Fig. 6c. The DPASV peak currents of Pb 2 + from pH 3.0 to 4.0 was a downward trend, afterwards, the electrochemical response increase notably up to pH = 6.0. The increase of peak currents in the range of 4.0 -6.0 can be attributed to the complexation mechanism and electrostatic interaction between numerous oxygen-containing groups (negatively charged) of ErNBC and positively charged Pb 2 + , and the p K a value of ErNBC probably in the range of 4.0 -6.0[43]. Considering that Pb 2 + can be hydrolyzed at a higher pH value, acetic acid buffer with pH = 6.0 is selected as the enrichment solution. By simulating the morphological distribution of Pb 2 + in aqueous solutions of different pH, it is found (Fig. 7e) that when pH < 6, lead mainly exists in the form of bivalent lead ion. When pH > 6 and gradually increased, Pb 2 + gradually combined with OH -, and finally precipitated. Under the condition of overacid, the hydroxyl functional group on the surface of biochar will be protonated, and the positive charge on the surface will reduce the adsorption amount of Pb 2 + , and the detection effect will be weakened. Under alkaline conditions, lead ions mainly exist in the combined state, which affects the electrochemical detection effect. Therefore, combined with Fig. 6c, the pH of buffer solution used for lead ion detection is the most appropriate choice at 6.

determined at Nafion/ErNBC/GCE electrode. Fig. 7b shows the DPASV response of modified electrode toward Pb 2 + at different concentrations. In the range of 80 to 1200 μ g/L, the DPASV peak current is proportional to the concentration of Pb 2 + . The linear equation is I$_{(}$ μ A) = 0.02087 c -2.6014 (R 2 $_{=}$ 0.9868), the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.49 μ g/L below ( S/N = 3) the maximum level of Pb 2 + (1 μ g/L) specified in the Chinese Drinking Water Standard. What ' s more, the limit of quantitation (LOQ) is 1.67 μ g/L ( S/N = 10). Both methods calculated detection limits below the World Health Organization ' s maximum level of Pb 2 + in the water environment (10 μ g/L). Therefore, the sensor can effectively detect Pb 2 + in water. The linear range and LOD are better than those reported in most typical Pb 2 + analysis literatures, as listed in Table 1.

Machine learning models of sensor (Fig. 7f and 7 g). The evaluation indexes of each model include the correlation coefficient (R$^{2}$) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the training set and the test set. Both the RMSE and R$^{2 }$measures are based on square error, so there will be some impact if the measurement contains outliers. To avoid this effect, the mean absolute error (MAE) was introduced to better evaluate the model. Generally speaking, the closer the RMSE and MAE errors are to 0, the smaller the model errors are, and the closer R$^{2 }$is to 1, the stronger the

To investigate the selectivity of the sensor, we measured its response to a variety of interfering ions, such as Cd 2 + , Fe 3 + , Ba 2 + , Co 2 + , Cr 2 + , Cu 2 + , Na + , etc[45,46]. The orange bar in Fig. 7d shows, the sensor ' s response to Pb 2 + is much higher than other metal ions, showing superior selectivity. In addition, the anti-interference performance of the sensor is also studied. The detection solution was 1 mg/L Pb 2 + with 10 times the concentration of interfering ions (Fig. 7d green bar chart). Table S3 shows that the change of Pb(II) response current is less than 15 % after adding interference ions[31], indicating that the sensor has good antiinterference ability.

Heavy metal ions are the most common environmental pollutants in water sources, such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), etc[44]. In this paper, Pb 2 + is selected to build theoretical calculation models (Fig. 7a), electrochemical detection models (Fig. 7c) and machine learning models (Fig. 7f and 7 g). Under the optimal experimental conditions, Pb 2 + was

Detection and analysis of Pb 2 + with DPASV response current as the independent variable and concentration as the dependent variable, linear regression models, K-nearest neighbor models and random forest models were established for the response current and concentration of Pb 2 + . 33 data points were tested in the Pb 2 + concentration range of 80 -1200 μ g/L, and 80 % were used as training samples, 20 % as test samples. From the 33 sample data, 26 data were selected as training sets, and the remaining 7 data were used as test sets to evaluate the performance of the model. As shown in Table S2, in the linear regression

model, the R$^{2}$, RMSE and MAE values in the training set of Pb 2 + were 0.9833, 48.6881 and 42.6593, respectively. In the test set, the R$^{2}$, RMSE and MAE values were 0.9711, 54.7728 and 46.0332, respectively, and the RPD value was 5.8776, higher than 3.0. The results show that the linear regression model can accurately predict the Pb 2 + concentration. In the K-nearest neighbor model, the R$^{2}$, RMSE and MAE values in the training set of Pb 2 + are 0.9851, 45.9431 and 37.2308, respectively. In the test set, the R$^{2}$, RMSE and MAE values are 0.9463, 74.5884 and 61.7143, respectively, and the RPD value is 4.3161, higher than 3.0. The results show that the K-nearest neighbor model can accurately predict the Pb 2 + concentration. In the random forest model, the R$^{2}$, RMSE and MAE values in the training set of Pb 2 + are 0.9985, 13.9926 and 9.7846, respectively. In the test set, the R$^{2}$, RMSE and MAE values are 0.9877, 35.6526 and 25.4857, respectively, and the RPD value is 9.0297, higher than 3.0. The results show that the random forest model can accurately predict the Pb 2 + concentration. The random forest model shows superiority among the three models. Due to the limited data samples in this experiment, the integrated model of machine learning did not play more advantages. Although the model of machine learning is prone to overfitting, the addition of machine learning model can make up for the lack of flexibility of the traditional regression model. In our actual electrochemical detection experiment, not all linear fitting relationships were found.

## 5. Determination of Pb 2 þ in real water samples

Actual samples were selected from river water (Liuyang River, Changsha, China) and farmland water (Yunyuan Base, Changsha, China). To verify the accuracy of the Nafion/ErNBC/GCE sensor, we compared the detection results with ICP and portable electrochemical detection methods. All the three methods used standard addition method to detect Pb 2 + . The results are shown in Table S4. The recovery rate of lead ions in water samples by the sensor is 97.6 % GLYPH<0> 102.2 %, which is close to the 98.3 %-103.2 % of the traditional method, confirming the reliability and accuracy of the sensor. Compared with traditional methods, Nafion/ErNBC/GCE sensor has the advantages of simple operation and low cost. Although the portable electrochemical detection method is easier to operate than the Nafion/ErNBC/GCE sensor, the detection accuracy of the sensor is higher than that of the portable electrochemical detection method (92.4 %-102.6 %). Therefore, the sensor can be appliedto the detection of actual water samples.

## 6. Conclusions

In summary, using tea residue as raw material, NBC was prepared by thermal decomposition method, and ErNBC was rapidly obtained on GCE by in-situ electrochemical reshaping of NBC in phosphate buffer. This method utilizes the CV method to prepare ErNBC from tea residue, making it possible to construct Pb 2 + electrochemical sensor with good sensing performance. At the same time, this study also provides ideas for the sustainable and green utilization of waste tea residue, and also provides a green and rapid electrochemical surface functionalization method for the preparation of ErNBC. However, there are also some shortcomings that need to be further studied. For example, it is found that the amount of materials prepared by electrochemical reduction method is relatively small, and it is difficult to industrialization and large-scale promotion. And with the rise of portable instruments, once the stability of portable electrodes is guaranteed, glassy carbon electrodes may gradually be replaced by small and easy to carry electrodes such as screen printed electrodes and flexible electrodes. Therefore, the materials prepared in this paper can also be tried to be used by portable instruments to broaden its application field.
