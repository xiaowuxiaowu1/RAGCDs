## ABSTRACT

The increasingly serious situation of CO$_{2 }$emissions compels researchers to pay extensive attention to industrial processes for carbon capture. Membrane-based separation technology is widely regarded as a promising reserve method for carbon capture, featuring a wide adjustment range, flexible operation and modular design. In this work, a large-scale interfacial polymerization membrane production process for carbon capture was developed together with the construction of novel interfacial polymerization equipment with an adjustable organic phase bath and surface cross-linking unit. A monomer suitable for efficiently preparing high-performance CO$_{2 }$ separation membranes was selected through a combination of experiments and simulations. The effect of production conditions on the structure and performance of large-scale membranes was investigated. The performance resilience at high pressure and short-term stability in the presence of impurities of the optimized membranes were examined. Techno-economic evaluation targeting carbon capture from post-combustion gas verifies the significant industrial application potential of the membranes.

## 1. Introduction

The comprehensive report of the Sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) evaluation report clarified the long-term risks and adverse effects of the continued intensification of global warming caused by human activities on nature and ecosystems, which forced the public to emphasize the urgency of carbon reduction and focus on advanced technologies with significant potential [1]. Meanwhile, the report pointed out that choices and actions taken within the next decade will significantly impact the present and future for thousands of years, emphasizing the need to strengthen climate action immediately. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to develop and promote effective carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology [2,3]. However, the continuous emission of post-combustion gas from coal-fired power plants is becoming a roadblock to carbon reduction. This kind

of carbon source has the characteristics of large volume, low pressure and complex components, which means that regardless of the method used, treating this type of exhaust gas always comes with high energy consumption and low product-added value [4,5].

Membrane-based carbon capture technology, featuring a wide adjustment range, flexible operation and modular design, is recognized as the next-generation technology oriented to the future with high capture efficiency and the expectation of a significant reduction in carbon capture costs [6 -8]. Nowadays, many advanced carbon capture materials have been developed in laboratories. However, converting these materials into industrial-scale preparation and membrane formation remains a thorny challenge [9]. Several institutions around the world, such as Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR) [10 -12], Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) [13, 14] and Tianjin University (TJU) [15,16], have reported successful

operation of pilots or demonstration devices using their self-developed membranes. In addition, some start-ups are collaborating with research institutions or developing independently to push outstanding achievements into practical applications, such as Cool Planet Technologies (GER) with the support from PolyActive ™ of Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, Compact Membrane Systems (US), Aqualung Carbon Capture (NOR) whose technologies originate from NTNU and OOYOO (JP) in cooperation with Kyoto University. Nonetheless, with very few exceptions [17 -20], there have been almost no reports on large-scale membrane production, which may also be the reason for the fundamental contradiction between the increasingly improving performance of membrane materials and the few carbon capture membranes available for industrialization.

Interfacial polymerization (IP), coupling reaction and diffusion with complex regulation, is a rapid-reactive and self-inhibiting membrane preparation process that has been widely applied in manufacturing reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes [22 -24]. The inherent

characteristics of this process give it natural advantages in preparing gas separation membranes. On the one hand, it is relatively easy to obtain a thin and defect-free separation layer with stable separation performance at higher pressures under the broad tolerance of the equipment accuracy [25,26]. On the other hand, the interfacial polymerization processes can take full use of the multiple kinds of monomers to tailor the membrane properties specifically according to different application scenarios by adopting the interfacial engineering strategy [27].

To completely solve the above problems, our team developed a new type of IP process for gas separation membranes, that is, in the membrane-preparing process, the pre-modified polysulfone substrate coated with the cross-linked silicone rubber as the gutter layer is first impregnated on one side through an organic phase containing acid chloride, and then polymerizing in the aqueous solution containing amine monomers, referred to as the " oil before water " process [30 -32]. The silicone rubber that can be swollen in the organic phase is capable of maintaining enough acid chloride on the surface and providing a diffusion domain of sufficient thickness to meet the needs of separation layer growth, avoiding the pore penetration of amidation [33 -35].

According to the traditional IP process, uniform and dense composite membranes are achieved by processing the polysulfone substrate successively through an aqueous phase containing amine monomers and reacting in an organic phase containing acid chloride [28]. The separation layer is firmly bonded to the substrate through the amide grown deep into the pores and maintains high permeability when fully swollen with water. Unfortunately, this situation is reversed when treating mixed gases. The infiltrated separation layer provides additional diffusion resistance greatly, attenuating the gas permeability and selectivity [29]. Therefore, due to the difficulty in removing the aqueous amine monomer in the pores of the polysulfone substrate, the IP method has rarely been reported for gas separation membranes.

In this research, the IP equipment with an adjustable organic phase bath and surface cross-linking unit were developed for the industrial manufacture of composite membranes for CO$_{2 }$separation. Based on the combination of experiments and simulation calculations, an amine monomer with high cross-phase diffusion and reaction rates, high membrane-forming efficiency and satisfying as-made membrane

In our previous research, the commercially available polymeric membrane industrially prepared by the novel coating machine with double blades and a surface cross-linking unit was first reported with practically high CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ separation performance [18]. The as-made separation layer was produced through the simple physical solvent evaporation of the wet coating layer consisting of a mixed cross-linked network polymer (PPPS) composed of polyvinylamine (PVAm) with high molecular weight [21], polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which can be easily affected by the thickness fluctuation of the gutter layer and the discrepancy of interfacial properties between the hydrophobic gutter layer and the water-based coating solution, thereby resulting in uneven chain segment stacking and aggregation state of the polymer. Meanwhile, the coating solution constantly undergoes uneven lateral shrinkage during drying due to the difficulty in further reducing the liquid-solid surface tension on the gutter layer, considering the negative impact of excessive additives on the separation performance. These phenomena can ultimately lead to differences in the spatial distribution of membrane performance, resulting in difficulty in accurately evaluating the performance of membrane modules.

performance was selected. Furthermore, the optimized operating parameters of the designed equipment were investigated to prepare CO$_{2 }$ separation membranes industrially. Developing the large-scale membrane production process via interfacial polymerization can enrich the preparation method system for gas separation membranes and broaden the limitations of materials on large-scale membrane production.

## 2. Experimental section

## 2.1. Materials

Piperazine, N -aminoethyl piperazine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, 3,3 ' -diaminodipropylamine were all purchased from Meryer (Shanghai) Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. N , N ' -bis(2-aminoethyl) piperazine was obtained from Shanghai Bidepharm Technology Co., Ltd (China). 3,3 ' -diaminoN -methyldipropylamine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA. 3,3 ' -bis (Methylamino)N -Methyldipropylamine was bought from Adamas-beta Reagent. Trimesoyl chloride (TMC), sodium hydroxide and heptane were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). The polysulfone substrate with a N$_{2 }$ permeance over 140000 GPU was provided by Zeuhor New Material Technology (Shandong) Co., Ltd. The substrate was coated with the cross-linked silicone rubber reported in our previous work before being used. The deionized water with a conductivity lower than 5 μ S/cm was produced by a water purification system.

## 2.2. Interfacial polymerization equipment with an adjustable organic phase bath and surface cross-linking unit

In this work, to systematically regulate various operating parameters of the preparation process on the membrane-forming and membrane performance, we designed the IP equipment with an adjustable organic phase bath and surface cross-linking unit. The schematic diagram and physical image of the equipment are shown in Fig. 1. Particularly, the organic phase bath was designed to be movable overall so that the impact of organic solution inventory that determines the membrane forming integrity on large-scale preparation can be accurately examined by adjusting the coating wiring distance of the organic phase bath from the aqueous phase bath. In addition, to simultaneously achieve crosslinking modification and to provide a protective coating on the membrane surface, the surface cross-linking unit was equipped between the two drying tunnels. This protective layer has been shown to effectively protect the integrity of the separation layer in the processes of membrane winding, transportation and module rolling [18]. In continuous operation of the facility, the substrate membranes pre-coated with silicone rubber are released from the unwinding unit, followed by passing through the organic phase bath and aqueous phase bath in sequence with front-surface contact. After the formation of the polyamide separation layer, the membranes are rapidly dried in the first drying tunnel and then dip-coated with pre-crosslinked silicone rubber containing TMC in the surface cross-linking unit. Finally, membranes with the protective layer are recycled in the winding unit after removing the remaining solution in the second drying tunnel.

The other differences between traditional and the as-designed equipment are as follows. (1) The friction between the silicone rubber gutter layer and the front roller generates high-intensity static electricity

(sometimes even more than 20 kV on the surface), which affects the surface spreadability of the organic solution and causes serious safety hazards to organic vapor in the environment. Thus, we installed two sets of ionizing air knives before and after the organic phase bath to eliminate static electricity. (2) Due to the high viscosity and boiling point of water compared to organic solvents, a large amount of aqueous solution is enriched on the surface of the separation layer, affecting the drying efficiency and causing waste and pollution of the expensive amine monomers. By installing an air knife between the drying tunnel and the aqueous phase bath, the temperature of the drying tunnels can be reduced to 70 · C and more than 60% of amine monomer can be recycled (calculated based on the membrane area produced by one feeding before and after installing the air knife). (3) The organic phase bath and aqueous phase bath are configured with a hydronic heating system to maintain appropriate operating temperatures for controlling the swelling degree of silicone rubber and the membrane-forming reaction rate, respectively. The surface cross-linking bath with an overflow device is equipped with a circulating refrigeration system with a temperature accuracy of ± 0.5 · C to prevent silicone rubber from overcrosslinking and solidifying [18,36]. (4) To eliminate the interference of environmental factors in production, a semi-enclosed clean operation room with a joint system of temperature control and ventilation was installed inside the interface polymerization unit. The control precision of temperature can reach up to 1 · C with the in-room air being replaced every 15 min.

## 2.3. Preparation of the polymeric membranes

The separation layer produced in this work is based on the highpermeance silicone rubber gutter layer developed by our team [18, 36]. The layer-by-layer structure of the produced membrane is displayed in Fig. 2.

The detailed membrane fabrication process by IP is as follows. Before starting formal production, the temperature control system of the equipment should be operated to pre-heat the baths at 25 · C and the drying tunnels at 70 · C. The polysulfone substrates coated with silicone rubber were first uncoiled from the unwinding unit and then immersed on one side into the organic phase bath after being treated with an ionizing air knife to avoid the negative effects of accumulated static electricity. At a fixed reaction distance between the first back roller of the aqueous phase bath and the air knife at 1.5 m, the ideal operating line speed is merely determined by the reaction duration required for the optimal amine monomer to form complete membranes. Then, the substrates loaded with TMC were conveyed to the aqueous phase bath to

The lab-scale membrane preparation process was designed to simulate industrial conditions. The modified polysulfone substrate was dipped on the front side into the organic phase consisting of 0.005 mol/L TMC as solute for 20 s, followed by drying upside down naturally for another 30 s. Then, the treated substrate was immersed on the front side in the aqueous solution with 0.01 mol/L of the alternative amine monomers and 0.025 mol/L of sodium hydroxide as acid absorbent for the reaction time in 10-s increments till the membranes were visually intact and exhibit a comparable CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$(15/85 vol%) mixed gas separation performance. The as-prepared separation layer was blown lengthwise on the surface by an air knife and placed in a blast drying oven at 70 · C.

yield the thin and intimate separation layer. After being dewatered by the air knife with high power and stable wind pressure, the separation layer was dried by the bridge-type drying tunnels at the rising temperature in ascending order of tunnel segments with the highest temperature at 70 · C. Afterward, the separation layer was delivered into the surface cross-linking unit to be dip-coated with the pre-crosslinked silicone rubber mixed with the TMC as the cross-linking agent that could react with the remaining amine groups on the surface of the separation layer. Finally, the protective layer was dried in the blast drying tunnel with a constant temperature of 25 · C and then rolled up in the winding unit. The key operating parameters in this work are listed in Table S1.

According to different conditions, the naming rules of the membranes produced in this work are α Aβ Tγ WD, which respectively represent the membranes prepared with the amine monomer concentration at α % (mass fraction of total solvent, the same below), acid chloride concentration at β % and the coating wiring distance between the last back roller of the organic phase bath and the first back roller of the aqueous phase bath (abbreviated as coating wiring distance) of γ m. Unless otherwise mentioned, the same conditions are not mentioned in the names.

## 2.4. Characterization

The electrostatic potentials and parameters for predicting nucleophilic reactivity according to the conceptual density functional theory of the monomers were calculated by the Gaussian 16W program with the basis set of 6-311G** in the DFT-B3LYP method. The solution continuum model for calculating amine monomers was set to heptane. The quantitative molecular surface analysis was exported by Multiwfn software Version 3.8(dev), updated on December 8, 2023 [37,38].

The membranes prepared in this work were evaluated in a lab-made membrane performance testing platform by CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ (15/85 vol%) mixed gas [39]. The detailed test method is as follows. The membrane samples were randomly taken from the production line and then placed

The surface and cross-section morphologies of the membranes were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 430, FEI, USA). The qualitative analysis of cross-interface mass transfer kinetics was investigated by a UV -visible spectrophotometer (UV-VIS, UV2600, Shimadzu, Japan). The element composition of the membranes without the protective layer was analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB-250Xi, UK).

in a constant temperature and humidity container with the temperature at 25 · C and relative humidity at 40% overnight to eliminate the stress between the polymer molecules in the separation layer after rapid drying. During the test, the membranes underwent a short period of pre-humidification and then were placed into the membrane cell with an effective test area of 19.62 cm$^{2}$. The feed mixture was water-saturated by humidifiers and passed into the membrane cell. The test pressure was achieved by the constant flow of the retentate gas at 2 L/min and regulating the pressure-reducing valve. To ensure that the performance is calculated under approximately ideal conditions to investigate the application potential of the prepared membranes, the typical stage cut was kept as low as possible at about 0.015. The permeate gas that had measured the flow rate was analyzed by gas chromatograph (SP-3510, Beifen-ruili Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd, China) to evaluate gas composition. The optimized membranes were also assessed by CO$_{2}$/CH$_{4 }$ (10/90 vol%) and CO$_{2}$/H$_{2 }$(40/60 vol%) mixed gases, corresponding to the separating demand of natural gas and syngas. The resistance to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides of the as-prepared membranes with the optimal CO$_{2 }$ separation performance were also investigated by a 60-h continuous test using the simulated post-combustion gas consisting of 110 ppm SO$_{2}$, 30 ppm NO$_{x}$, 15 vol% CO$_{2 }$and balanced by N$_{2}$. Each group of samples repeated the above test three times to prevent measurement errors.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Selection of the amine monomers

The amine monomers used for industrially preparing gas separation membranes by IP should feature the following characteristics. (1) Due to the lack of sufficient swelling agents during separation, the prepared membranes should be kept as high free volume as possible even in the unswollen state while ensuring the integrity of the membrane structure and excellent selectivity for target components to provide acceptable gas permeance at lower operating pressures compared to the membranes applied in conventional reverse osmosis. Therefore, the amine monomers should be selected with flexible segments to provide high free volume. (2) Amino groups with a strong affinity with CO$_{2 }$are commonly used functional groups. However, once they participate in the IP process to form amide groups, the electron rearrangement and steric hindrance caused by the bulky side groups always lead to a sharp decrease in the

## Cross-phase Diffusion Rate (*10-10 mollm?Is)

Fig. 4. Comparative radar plots of physical and chemical properties of candidate amine monomers. The cross-phase diffusion rate, condensed local nucleophilicity index and retail price were detailed listed in Table S2~S4. The membrane formation time was determined by combining visual observation of the integrity and testing the separation performance of the membranes prepared by controlling the reaction time in 10-s increments. The membrane formation time and the corresponding performance of all amine monomers were also depicted in Fig. S3.

reactivity of the amino group toward CO$_{2}$. The sterically hindered amino group is considered a novel facilitated transport active site with a high CO$_{2 }$loading capacity and reaction rate in the presence of water [40 -42]. Simultaneously, its steric hindrance can effectively resist the attack of acid chloride from nucleophilic substitution. Thus, introducing sterically hindered amino groups into monomers can provide active sites for quick CO$_{2 }$ adsorption and transfer in a saturated humidity test environment [43]. (3) The industrial preparation of membranes by IP needs to consider the limitations of production efficiency. That is, the amine monomer should exhibit the ability to quickly traverse across the aqueous-organic phase interface and rapidly diffuse in the organic phase to react with the acid chloride. Therefore, the advanced facilitated transport membrane material PVAm is not applicable as the ideal amine monomer served in the interfacial polymerization process.

As we can see, only a few electronegative regions contributed by nitrogen atoms can react with acid chlorides. To a certain extent, the proportion of negative electrostatic potential surface can represent the probability of the monomers that diffuse into the reaction area participating in the IP reaction from a pure electrostatic point of view [44]. It is generally accepted that the condensed Fukui functions (CFF), the condensed dual descriptors (CDD) and the condensed local nucleophilicity index (CLNI) can be used to quantitatively describe the activity of nucleophilic reactions [45 -47]. For nucleophilic monomers, the higher the CFF and CLNI, or the lower the CDD, the stronger the amidation activity. In addition, the cross-phase diffusion rate of the monomers determines the number of monomers amidated within a certain period, which is specifically reflected in the membrane formation time. Therefore, to comprehensively compare the industrial application value of amine monomers, the membrane formation time, cross-phase diffusion rate, condensed local nucleophilicity index and retail price are presented comparatively in Fig. 4. The radar plots also show the separation performance of corresponding membranes prepared in the laboratory tested by CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ (15/85 vol%) mixed gas with saturated humidity at 25 · C and 0.30 MPa.

Fig. 3 shows nine amine monomers investigated in this work. The electron density of amine monomers with the minimal electrostatic potential of molecular van der Waals surface and the areas of electrostatic potential on the surface of amine monomers are respectively shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. S2. The parameters for quantifying reactivity and the proportion of negative electrostatic potential surface are listed in Table S2.

Specifically, for monomers containing piperazine (monomers 1, 2 and 3), introducing the aminoethyl group weakens the reactivity of the monomers, while the increasingly exposed proportion of negative electrostatic potential surface enhances the probability of monomers participating in the polymerization. Besides, using piperazine with extremely high CLNI do not significantly reduce the membrane formation time, which is due to the relatively high minimal electrostatic potential of the molecular van der Waals surface, resulting in inferior reaction efficiency. The membranes prepared by N , N ' -bis(2-aminoethyl) piperazine (monomer 3 with two aminoethyl groups modified on the N1 and N2 based on piperazine) exhibit much higher CO$_{2 }$permeance and CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$selectivity, which can be attributed to the tertiary amine groups as effective delivery carriers improving the CO$_{2 }$separation performance, but the relative slow membrane formation rate and exorbitant retail price prevent its use in industrial production.

For monomers consisting of ethyleneimine units (monomers 4, 5 and 6), the extension of the molecular chain increases the number of polycondensation reaction sites but significantly reduces the total reactivity. Monomers with similar structures but increased molecular weight result in a greatly reduced cross-phase diffusion rate, thus expanding the membrane formation time overall. At the same time, it can be speculated from the separation performance that the increase of amine reaction sites is not conducive to enhancing the cross-linking degree of membranes. In summary, simultaneously enhancing the cross-phase diffusion rate and nucleophilic reactivity is beneficial for improving membrane

## formation efficiency.

Inspired by the conclusion above, we tried to employ amine monomer 7 with extra electron-donating secondary carbons for the IP process. Unfortunately, introducing secondary carbons only slightly enhances the reactivity from the view of the minimal electrostatic potential of molecular van der Waals surface, yet weakening the cross-phase diffusion rate. Therefore, to incorporate active tertiary amine groups and further improve interfacial mass transfer efficiency, monomers 8 and 9 were employed to produce membranes by IP. As predicted, monomer 8 with an additional methyl group grafted on N2 based on monomer 7 exhibits a much higher cross-phase diffusion rate than monomer 7 and practically maintains the reactivity of N1. Although the amidation activity of monomer 9 with two methyl groups modified N1 based on monomer 8 significantly reduces than monomer 8 due to steric hindrance, the greatly accelerated trans -phase delivery increases the number of monomers participating in the reaction in a short period. Therefore, the membrane formation time of monomers 8 and 9 significantly reduces to 20 -30 s, which can already meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale membrane production. The introduction of tertiary amine groups also greatly improves the CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ separation performance of the as-prepared membranes. Compared with the membranes prepared by monomer 8, the superior CO$_{2 }$permeance and inferior CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ selectivity of membranes prepared by monomer 9 can be attributed to the relatively loose separation layer structure. Considering various influencing factors, monomer 8 (DNMDAM) was ideally selected for the industrial fabrication of CO$_{2 }$separation membranes by IP.

## 3.2. Industrial preparation of membranes by interfacial polymerization

In this section, we tried to interfacially polymerize the selected amine monomer DNMDAM with TMC on a large scale with a constant reaction temperature of 25 · C. The web speed is a pivotal indicator that determines production efficiency. However, owing to the present situation of the required membrane formation time of at least 30 s and the immovable reaction distance of the current equipment at 1.5 m, the optimal operating line speed was constrained at 3 m/min (9.84 ft/min), although it is quite slower than the commercial web speed of 20 -30 ft/ min. Therefore, the key operational parameters remain the monomer concentrations in both two phases and the coating wiring distance. Besides, the optimized membranes ' performance resilience at high pressure and short-term stability in the presence of impurities were also examined.

## 3.2.1. Optimization of DNMDAM concentration

The thickness and cross-linking degree of membranes are two decisive parameters that seriously affect gas separation performance. Therefore, the effect of amine monomer concentrations on the membrane structure was examined by measuring the thickness of the separation layer via the SEM cross-sectional image (Fig. S4) and the O/N content via XPS analysis. To obtain as accurate thickness as possible, we sampled the inspected membranes randomly after the first bridge-type drying tunnels, that is, there was no protective layer on the separation layer. As illustrated in Fig. S3, the smooth and flat surface confirms that the intact membrane structure is completely different from the " peakvalley " structure of the traditional IP membranes, which may be related to the insufficient intensity of the reaction and employing sodium hydroxide as an acid absorbent to avoid the generation of interface bubbles [32]. A dividing line between the separation layer and the gutter layer can be clearly visible in the cross-sectional structure, indicating the ordinary interlayer bonding force. The measured thickness of the

The effect of amine monomer concentration on the properties of the membranes was investigated with fixed TMC concentration at 0.1%, reaction temperature at 25 · C, line speed at 3 m/min and the coating wiring distance at 4 m. Membranes prepared by four different amine monomer concentrations were respectively named as 0.075A-0.1T, 0.1A-0.1T, 0.125A-0.1T and 0.15A-0.1T.

separation layer fluctuates around 120 nm, almost irrespective of the amine monomer concentrations. As depicted in Fig. 5, the cross-linking extents of membranes show an increasing trend as the amine monomer concentrations increase. These phenomena are consistent with membranes produced on the laboratory scale of our previous works [48,49].

CO$_{2 }$separation performance of the as-prepared membranes changes with the changing membrane thickness and cross-linking degree. As displayed in Fig. 5, the CO$_{2 }$and N$_{2 }$permeance decrease with increasing amine monomer concentration, which is jointly decided by the fluctuating separation layer thickness and the increasing cross-linking extent that reduces the free volume of the fabricated membrane, leading to the rising CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$selectivity. Considering expensive amine monomer costs and trade-offs of CO$_{2 }$ permeance and CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ selectivity, the optimal DNMDAM concentration was selected as 0.1%.

It is believed that IP is a coupling process of aqueous monomers diffusing into the organic phase and reacting with acid chlorides. For the traditional IP process, the reaction rate is controlled by the diffusion of amine monomers into the primary layer in the organic phase [26]. Therefore, the higher the concentration of amine monomers, the more they transfer across the primary layer, eventually triggering self-inhibition and generating a thicker separation layer. For the reverse process in this work, when the amine monomer content is unlimited and continuously updated during industrial production, this process is determined by the diffusion rate of TMC from the organic phase to the primary layer [48,49]. The increasing concentration of DNMDAM accelerates the monomers crossing the phase interface, thereby intensifying the competition between the polycondensation and hydrolysis of TMC, which in turn leads to an increase in the cross-linking degree of the produced membranes.

## 3.2.2. Optimization of the TMC concentration

The effect of TMC concentration on the membrane properties was investigated with fixed DNMDAM concentration at 0.1%, reaction temperature at 25 · C, line speed at 3 m/min and the coating wiring distance at 4 m. The inspected TMC concentrations for industrial IP

## ranged from 0.05% to 0.2% in 0.025% increments.

Both thickness and cross-linking extent collaboratively determine the separation performance of membranes produced by different TMC concentrations. As revealed in Fig. 6, the permeance of CO$_{2 }$and N$_{2 }$of the 0.1A-0.05T membranes are abnormally high yet with an extremely low CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ selectivity, indicating the incomplete membrane structure grown at lower TMC concentrations. With the combined effect of increased thickness and cross-linking extent, the membranes exhibit gradually decreasing CO$_{2 }$ and N$_{2 }$ permeance. The gradually growing CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ selectivity intimates the membrane structure to be more consummate and denser as the TMC concentration increases. Besides, the decrease in selectivity of the produced membranes at TMC concentrations higher than 0.175% can be attributed to the reduction of crosslinking extent. Therefore, the optimized TMC concentration was 0.1%

The thickness and cross-linking extent of the membranes prepared by different TMC concentrations were investigated by SEM and XPS. The separation layer thickness of membranes (Fig. S5) exhibits slight variation, indicating the excellent consistency of industrial membrane production. The properties of membranes prepared by different TMC concentrations are summarized in Fig. 6. The separation layer thicknesses of the corresponding membranes rise uniformly with increasing TMC concentration, while the cross-linking extents display a gradual upward trend with the TMC concentration ranging from 0.05% to 0.175% and then a downward trend at 0.2%. As mentioned in the above section, the membrane structure is dominated by the diffusing characteristic of TMC. The increased concentration of TMC accelerates its diffusion to the primary layer, resulting in the increasing intensity of amidation against hydrolysis in the short IP period, generating a highly cross-linked membrane structure. However, when the TMC concentration is high enough at 0.2%, the hydrolysis of the rapidly enriched acid chloride is accelerated, decreasing the cross-linking extent. Besides, abundant TMC can also support the DNMDAM monomer in diffusing farther, thereby thickening the separation layer. Therefore, the liquid inventory on the gutter layer should be investigated to ensure that the amine monomer can diffuse evenly in adequate quantities.

by mass ratio.

## 3.2.3. Optimization of the coating wiring distance

Taking this work as an example, parameters that affect heptane volatilization degree include environmental conditions such as ambient

Different from the traditional IP process, due to the high volatility of organic solvents, the residual amount of heptane remaining on the gutter layer can affect the diffusion behavior of amine monomers into the organic phase and the integrity of the membrane formation (Fig. 7), which is often overlooked in the laboratory-scale production process. It was reported that controllable membrane morphology could be achieved by interface manipulation of traditional IP [50]. Conversely, the " oil before water " process can also adjust the membrane structure by regulating the state of the organic phase solution. Excessive volatilization of heptane will expose TMC to the environment and cause the hydrolysis reaction with water vapor, thereby hindering the generation of a complete separation layer. Too much residual heptane can also cause the separation layer to be suspended above the gutter layer, significantly decreasing the interlayer binding force. The stress-driven instability of the separation layer grown in suspension on the gutter layer leads to the formation of multi-wrinkled membrane surfaces [51], damaging the separation performance, uniformity and service life of the membranes. Taking this work as an example, parameters that affect heptane

temperature and air update frequency, as well as the volatilization time controlled by the coating wiring distance between the organic phase bath and the aqueous phase bath at fixed operating line speed. The temperature and ventilation control system of the semi-closed clean operation room can keep the volatilization rate of heptane constant. Therefore, the impact of the retained heptane volume on the membrane structure is qualitatively reflected by adjusting the coating wiring distance ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 m after measurement, which converts into an evaporation time of 40 -100 s. The effect of coating wiring distance was experimented with by fixed DNMDAM concentration at 0.1%, TMC concentration at 0.1%, reaction temperature at 25 · C and line speed at 3 m/min with the constant other conditions. The membranes were prepared by adjusting the coating wiring distance in steps of 1 m, which were respectively defined as 2WD, 3WD, 4WD and 5WD. Among them, the preparation conditions of 4WD are consistent with the 0.1A-0.1T membranes in the previous two sections.

Affected by the low cross-linking extent and thin separation layer thickness, 5DW membranes exhibit relatively high permeance of both gas pairs but low CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ selectivity. Compared with the 4DW membranes, the shorter evaporation time of the organic phase solution of the 3DW membranes elongates the diffusion distance of the DNMDAM and enlarges the separation layer thickness, leading to weakened CO$_{2 }$and N$_{2 }$ permeance but almost constant CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ selectivity. As for the 2WD membranes with the organic phase evaporating for only 40 s, although a defect-free separation layer is generated on the gutter layer, the potential microscopic deformation and large specific surface area of the suspended separation layer lead to increased permeance but extremely reduced selectivity. Simultaneously, it can also be visually observed that many small molecule oligomers are recovered from the membrane surface into the aqueous bath by the air knife, which affects potential adverse on subsequent membrane production.

The surface and cross-section morphologies of membranes are shown in Fig. S6. The floating separation layers of 2WD and 3WD membranes engender irregular wrinkles, while the significant monomer diffusion instability of 5WD membranes emerges with regular nano-Turing structures. The thickness and cross-linking extent were detected to reflect the impact of residual organic solution on membrane performance. As shown in Fig. 8, the thickness of the membranes increases proportionally as the coating wiring distance decreases, which is attributed to the quantitative increase in the organic solution inventory. When the coating wiring distance reaches the minimum, the resistance from the primary layer interferes with the diffusion of amine monomer within a limited reaction time, resulting in only a slight increase in the separation layer thickness of 2WD membranes. The cross-linking extent essentially depends on the number of monomers that participate in polymerization, therefore remaining almost constant at higher organic solution amounts yet preserving a lower level after 100-s evaporation of the organic solution, which is consistent with the previous analysis.

Test conditions: A, a short-term stability test by CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$(15/85 vol%) mixed gas with saturated humidity and feed pressure at 0.50 MPa for 60 h. B, an impurity resistance test by simulated post-combustion gas (110 ppm SO$_{2}$, 30 ppm NO$_{x}$, 15 vol% CO$_{2 }$and balanced by N$_{2}$) with saturated humidity at 25 · C and feed pressure at 0.50 MPa for 60 h. A ' , a restorative test by CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$(15/85 vol%) mixed gas with saturated humidity and feed pressure at 0.50 MPa for 40 h. All the tests were performed at a temperature of 25 · C.

adjustable organic phase bath and surface cross-linking unit were determined as DNMDAM concentration at 0.1%, TMC concentration at 0.1%, reaction temperature at 25 · C, line speed at 3 m/min and coating wiring distance at 4 m. We further examined the short-term stability of the membranes under different pressures and impurity resistance by simulated post-combustion gas. Fig. 9 shows the performance resilience of the prepared membrane with the feed gas pressure cycling from 0.11 MPa to 1.50 MPa in 20 h. The gradually decreasing CO$_{2 }$permeance of the optimized membrane with the increasing feed gas pressure can be owing to the fact that the contribution of the tertiary amine groups as the active sites in the facilitated transport of CO$_{2 }$ to the total CO$_{2 }$ permeation gradually weakens with the increase of CO$_{2 }$partial pressure, which is also known as carrier saturation. The gradual decrease in N$_{2 }$ permeance can be attributed to the loose membrane structure that is prone to compaction at higher pressures, which is also confirmed by the

relatively low cross-linking extent. It is worth noticing that the membrane performance basically recovered after an additional 10 h of testing with the gradually reduced pressure, indicating that no stress defects appeared under higher pressure, thereby proving the compactness and integrity of the membrane.

The performance comparison of the optimized membranes in this work and other reported membranes listed in Table S5 also implies the acceptable potential for industrial application [17 -20,52]. Although the performance of membranes prepared in this work does not exhibit as high as that of some membranes produced by blade coating methods, the as-developed IP with large adjustment space, wide range of optional monomers and convenient process of one-step production provides a feasible path for subsequent development of higher-level separation membranes.

The optimized membrane verified its excellent stability and impurity resistance through a three-stage investigation. As shown in Fig. 10, the prepared membrane was followed by a 60-h short-term stability test (Test A) at the feed gas pressure of 0.50 MPa. The separation performance around fluctuations of CO$_{2 }$permeance at 650 GPU and CO$_{2}$/N$_{2 }$ selectivity at 50 indicates that the optimized membrane can maintain relatively stable operation in the short term. When the feed gas was converted from binary gas to simulated post-combustion gas in Test B, the trace amounts of SO$_{2 }$ and NO$_{2 }$ impurities led to a significant reduction in membrane performance because of the prioritized adsorption and reaction of impurities than CO$_{2 }$of the active sites, impeding the facilitated transport efficiency of CO$_{2 }$in the membranes. However, the restoration of initial performance (Test A ' ) only by removing the impurities from the feed gas indicates the reversible adverse effects of contaminants without distortion on the structure, proving the extremely high impurity tolerance of the membrane.

The separation performance of the optimized membranes for CO$_{2}$/ CH$_{4 }$(10/90 vol%) and CO$_{2}$/H$_{2 }$(40/60 vol%) mixed gases was inspected to verify the feasibility of expanding application areas. As drawn in Fig. S7, the 0.1A-0.1T-4WD membranes show acceptable separation capabilities at lower test pressures without plasticization at high feed gas pressure (1.50 MPa), indicating excellent structural stability of the membranes.

## 3.2.5. Techno-economic evaluation of the membranes targeting carbon capture from post-combustion gas

To verify the industrial application potential of the membranes produced in this work, two-stage membrane separation processes loaded with the optimized 0.1A-0.1T-4WD membranes were modeled for conducting the techno-economic evaluation at CO$_{2 }$capture purity of 95% and CO$_{2 }$ recovery of 90%. Employing the hypotheses in the previous literature, we selected a typical coal-fired power plant outputting 550 MWe net power with the post-combustion gas emitted at 22 kmol s GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$as the processing target emission source. The gas composition used in the simulation was identified as 68.8% N$_{2}$, 13.5% CO$_{2}$, 15.3% H$_{2}$O and 2.4% O$_{2}$, which had been widely adopted by many researchers [53,54]. The membrane performance used for simulation was fitted by a power function with CO$_{2 }$partial pressure as the x-axis and CO$_{2 }$permeance as the y-axis in Fig. S8. Based on the preliminary estimation of converted membrane costs on an industrial scale (Table S6), the comparison of the techno-economic evaluation results and the corresponding involved parameters were detailed listed in Table S7 and Table S8. With maintaining the operating pressure ratio (ratio of feed pressure to permeate pressure) at 5, the energy consumption and capture costs of three kinds of two-stage membrane separation processes ("compression + vacuum", "compression with energy recovery" and "vacuum") were compared. The converged simulation results verify the "compression + vacuum" process (Fig. 11) with a satisfying electricity consumption of 1.545 GJ/tCO$_{2}$, indicating the potential application value of the produced membranes in this work. Required by the vacuum pumping process on the high permeance, the specific capture cost is simulated as 43.29 $/tCO$_{2 }$ for achieving the established capture goal due to the relatively large membrane area. Nonetheless, the two-stage "compression + vacuum" membrane separation process can effectively balance both membrane area and operating energy consumption with the lowest CO$_{2 }$ capture cost, which is consistent with the reported conclusions [55,56].

## 4. Conclusions

In this work, the interfacial polymerization equipment with an adjustable organic phase bath and surface cross-linking unit for industrially producing high-performance CO$_{2 }$ separation membranes was designed and established for the first time. The DNMDAM monomer with the flexible framework, tertiary amine group, high cross-phase diffusion rate and reactivity was selected by analyzing the necessary properties of amine monomers required for industrial preparation. The industrial production process of polymeric composite membranes for carbon capture by interfacial polymerization was first reported with DNMDAM as the aqueous phase monomer and TMC as the organic phase monomer by regulating the concentration of the monomers and coating wiring distance. Performance resilience at high pressure, short-term stability in the presence of impurities and techno-economic evaluation results preliminarily validated the feasible potential for industrial-scale applications of optimized membranes.
