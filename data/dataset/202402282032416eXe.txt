## ABSTRACT

Carbon-based supercapacitors have shown great promise for miniaturized electronics and electric vehicles, but are usually limited by their low volumetric performance, which is largely due to the inefficient utilization of carbon pores in charge storage. Herein, we develop a reliable and scalable boric acid templating technique to prepare boron and oxygen co-modified highly-dense yet ultramicroporous carbons (BUMCs). The carbons are featured with high density (up to 1.62 g cm GLYPH<0> $^{3}$), large specific surface area (up to 1050 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), narrow pore distribution (0.4 -0.6 nm) and exquisite pore surface functionalities (mainly -BC$_{2}$O, GLYPH<0> BCO$_{2}$, and -COH groups). Consequently, the carbons show exceptionally compact capacitive energy storage. The optimal BUMC-0.5 delivers an outstanding volumetric capacitance of 431 F cm GLYPH<0> 3 and a high-rate capability in 1 M H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$. In particular, an ever-reported high volumetric energy density of 32.6 Wh L GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$can be harvested in an aqueous symmetric supercapacitor. Our results demonstrate that the -BC$_{2}$O and -BCO$_{2 }$ groups on the ultramicropore walls can facilitate the internal SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> ion transport, thus leading to an unprecedented high utilization efficiency of ultramicropores for charge storage. This work provides a new paradigm for construction and utilization of dense and ultramicroporous carbons for compact energy storage.

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid development of mobile electronics and electric vehicles, electrochemical energy storage (EES) has undoubtedly become one of the most promising technologies in storing and delivering electrical energy.[1 -6] Among various EES devices, carbon-based supercapacitors represent a hot topic of research due to their remarkable merits, such as fast charging capability, long cycle lifetime, and safe operation.[7 -9] To meet the rising demand for miniaturized and light devices, the exploitation of carbon electrode materials with high volumetric capacitance performance has become a more critical merit in carbon-based supercapacitors.[10 -12].

The commonly employed techniques to construct ultramicropores in carbons include physical or chemical activation,[23,24] template method,[25,26] and pyrolysis of supramolecular compounds.[27] Both physical and chemical activations can endow the carbons with high porosity and large specific surface area, but fail to precise control over pore diameter and thus normally result in low packing density of carbon products. Despite that abundant ultramicropores can be fabricated by employment of microporous templates (e.g. zeolites, metal -organic frameworks) or direct pyrolysis of supramolecular, whereas they are still faced with insufficient ion accessibility and slow ion diffusion in tortuous porosity. In addition, mechanical compression[28,29] and capillarity contraction[30,31] can provide different solutions to deal with the trade-off between density and porosity of carbons by effectively reducing their macropores and mesopores, however, these strategies are ineffective for regulation and modification of ultramicropores. Although post-modification represents an effective method to decorate open carbon frameworks with favorable surface functionalities, it becomes impotent for ultramicroporous carbon channels due to the inherent complexity and extreme confinement of them, which are not conducive to the entry and diffusion of chemical modifiers.[32].

Since the pioneering discovery of the anomalous capacitance increase in carbon sub-nanopores ( < 1 nm) by Chmiola et al. in 2006, many efforts have been made in understanding the capacitive behavior of electrolyte ions in the extremely confined carbon spaces.[13 -16] Raymundo-Pinero et al. suggested that pore filling was more efficient for the formation of electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC) when the pore size of carbon electrode decreases to ultramicropore regime ( < 0.7 nm). [17] Partial ion desolvation was proposed to explain the enhanced capacitance in ultramicropores: Owing to the distortion of the solvation when entering nanosized pores, the ions could get closer to the carbon wall so that the approaching distance of ions to the electrode surface is decreased.[18,19] These studies clearly demonstrate that ultramicroporous carbon may provide an ideal candidate to maximize the charge storage efficiency in a given pore volume. In this scenario, a significantly improved volumetric capacitance can be expected to be realized if massive and densely-packed ultramicropore channels can be integrated constructed in a bulky carbon. Nevertheless, to fully realize the compact energy storage in ultramicroporous carbons, ion accessibility and diffusion in such nanoconfined carbon channels are cognized as another ambivalent prerequisite, which are proposed to be governed not only by pore geometry, but by pore surface chemistry.[20 -22] To this end, a reliable and scalable ultramicropore engineering technique is urgently demanded to develop ultramicroporous yet dense carbon with delicate pore geometry and favorable surface chemistry for high volumetric performance supercapacitors, nonetheless, it remains a big challenge.

Recent methodological advances for pore engineering, specifically the molecular template method,[33 -35] open up a new opportunity to produce dense carbons with ultramicroporous features. Molecular template technique allows transplantation of molecular-level porogens to carbon precursors in advance, thereby the pore sizes of the resultant carbons are principally determined by the sizes of porogens. Beyond this, molecular template is also expected to endow densely-packed ultramicropores with in-situ formed surface functionalities at sub-

nanometer scale by selecting appropriate molecular templates containing desired heteroatoms (such as O, B, and N).[36] Therefore, we report a reliable and scalable boric acid templating technique to prepare boron (B) and oxygen (O) co-modified ultramicroporous carbons (BUMCs). Therein, the boric acid not only act as molecular-scale self-sacrificial template for the formation of ultramicropores, but serve as in-situ modifier for implantation of profitable surface functionalities. The BUMCs are characterized with high density (up to 1.62 g cm GLYPH<0> $^{3}$), large specific surface area (up to 1050 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), narrow ultramicropore distribution (0.4 -0.6 nm) and favourable pore surface functionalities (mainly -BC$_{2}$O, -BCO$_{2}$, and -COH groups). As a result, the carbon electrodes exhibit exceptionally compact capacitive energy storage, wherein the optimal one delivers an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of up to 431 F cm GLYPH<0> $^{3}$, and an ever-reported high volumetric energy density of 32.6 Wh L GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in aqueous electrolyte.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Materials preparation

First, 2 g of glucose was dissolved in 30 mL deionized water which had been added 2 mL ammonium hydroxide earlier, then different amounts of boric acid (the molar ratios of boric acid/glucose were 0, 0.2, 0.5 and 1, respectively) were slowly added and the mixed solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, the fully reacted solution was dried at 90 · C in air dry oven for 6 h, then transferred to vacuum drying oven keep drying at 90 · C for 6 h. The obtained solid precursors were calcinated at 800 · C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 · C min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$under N$_{2}$. The BUMCs were finally obtained after being thoroughly washed with hot deionized water (90 · C), followed by vacuum drying at 65 · C for 24 h. The obtained powders were referred as BUMCx ( x = 0, 0.2, 0.5 and 1, which refer to the molar ratios of boric acid and glucose). The unwashed sample was also collected and denoted as BUMCx -U.

## 2.2. Material characterizations

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on an ESCA-LAB250 microprobe. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were performed on a Bruker AXS D8-FOCUS diffractometer using monochromatized Cu-K α radiation. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi SU8010 microscope. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized by a Talos F200x (ThermoFisher Scientific) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry and elemental mapping were recorded also on the Talos F200x equipped with four-quadtant energy dispersive X-ray detectors. The pore structures of the samples were characterized by N$_{2 }$adsorption -desorption analysis at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 system. The specific surface areas were calculated by using the Brunauer -Emmett -Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distributions were determined from the DFT model using the adsorption branch. Micropore features were further analyzed by carbon dioxide adsorption at 273 K using a Quantachrome NOVA 2000 apparatus. The packing densities of the samples were measured by using a AccuPyc II 1340 density analyzer. The compaction density was roughly calculated according to the mass of each sample and the physical dimensions (the carbon powder was pressed at approximately 10 MPa in a home-made mold before measurement). Liquid  $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy test was conducted at ambient temperature through a bruker avance III 400 MHz equipment. The Raman spectra were recorded with a WITec alpha 300R Raman spectrometer under an excitation laser of 532 nm.

## 2.3. Fabrication of electrodes and symmetric supercapacitors

Typically, a carbon electrode was prepared by mixing the samples,

carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 within isopropanol. Then, the paste was transferred on Ti mesh (1 × 1 cm) and dried for 12 h at 65 ℃ . The dried electrode was pressed at 10 MPa for 60 s. Approximately, 2 mg of active material was loaded in each electrode. In the three-electrode system, the prepared carbon electrode, Pt electrode and saturated calomel electrode were employed as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, and the 1 M H$_{2}$SO$_{4 }$solution was used as the electrolyte. In the symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor system, two identical electrodes were separated by a fiberglass diaphragm using an aqueous electrolyte (1 M Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$), and then assembled into a columnar cell (diameter of ~ 15 mm).

## 2.4. Electrochemical measurements

The electrochemical performances of the electrodes were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge -discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods using a Biologic VMP3 electrochemical workstation. EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. The gravimetric capacitance ( C$_{g}$ ) of three-electrode system was calculated based on the GCD discharge plot by using the formula C g = It / m Δ V , where I (A) is the discharge current, t (s) is the discharge time, m (g) is the mass of active electrode material, and Δ V (V) is the potential window. The volumetric capacitance was calculated by the following equations C$_{V}$ = ρ C g , where the ρ (g cm GLYPH<0> $^{3}$) is the packing density of carbon sample. The specific capacitances of the symmetric supercapacitors were calculated using the following equation C s = 2 I Δ t / m Δ V , where m (g) is the average mass of active electrode material, the gravimetric energy density ( E$_{g}$ ) and gravimetric power density ( P$_{g}$ ) of the electrode based on two-electrode symmetrical supercapacitor were calculated from the following equations E g = C $_{s}$( Δ V $^{$_{)}$2$_{/}$$_{(}$}$8 × 3 . 6 ) and P$_{g}$ = E $_{g}$/ t , where Δ V , C$_{s }$ and t are the discharging potential window, the gravimetric capacitance and the discharging time (s), respectively. The volumetric energy density (E$_{V}$) and volumetric power density (P$_{V}$) were calculated by the formula E$_{V}$ = ρ E $_{g}$, P$_{V}$ = ρ P g .

## 2.5. Calculation methods

All calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew -Burke-Ernzerhof ' s exchange -correlation functional (PBE) as implemented in DMol3 package.[37] A double numerical basis set augmented with polarization function (DNP) was employed to describe the electronic structures under a spin-polarized scheme. Charge analysis was carried out on the basis of the Mulliken population distribution scheme.[38] In order to study the possible geometries of cation and anion adsorption on B-doped carbon surface, three B-doping models containing -BC$_{3}$, GLYPH<0> BC$_{2}$O, and -BCO$_{2 }$bonding patterns were constructed based on the XPS characterization. For comparison, a pure carbon surface model was also devised. Similar carbon-based cluster models have been previously adopted and demonstrated effectiveness for heteroatom doped-carbon materials.[39] The adsorption energies of clients (i.e. SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> ) on the substrates (i.e. non-doped carbon surface and three B doped surfaces with -BC$_{3}$, -BC$_{2}$O and -BCO$_{2 }$patterns.) are defined by E$_{ads}$ = GLYPH<0> [ E ( sub-client ) GLYPH<0> E ( sub ) GLYPH<0> E ( client ) ] , where E (sub), E (client), and E (sub-client) stands for the calculated energies of the bare substrates, the client, and the adsorption system, respectively. E$_{ads }$ represents the energy released by each substrate after adsorption of SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> .

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Synthesis and structure characterizations of BUMCs

Boric acid has usually been added to various carbon precursors to

prepared B-doped porous carbons, however, it generally fails to guarantee precise control over pore sizes.[40,41] This is because massive and randomly dispersed boric acid would transform into boric-oxygenic compounds (mainly B$_{2}$O$_{3}$) with diverse sizes when carbonized at high temperature, and thus inevitably generate carbon pores with different sizes after washing out the boric-oxygenic compounds particles. To this end, in our procedure carbon source of glucose was first reacted with boric acid in presence of ammonia (NH$_{3}$ · H$_{2}$O) to obtain a crosslinked product of borated glucose (BG, Scheme 1). In presence of ammonia (NH$_{3}$ · H$_{2}$O), boric acid will transform into a stable tetrahedral H$_{4}$BO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> and further react with cis-dihydroxy groups of glucose.[42] The esterification reaction between them can be identified by the  $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscope of as-prepared BG (Figure S1, Supporting Information), where the peaks at 6.9 and 2.2 ppms are assigned to borate mono-ester and borate di-ester, respectively.[43] It is noted that, the addition of NH$_{3}$ · H$_{2}$O can not only be used as alkaline treatment agent, but also as nitrogen dopant. This is because the negatively charged B-containing groups, as a result of reactions of glucose with boric acid, can effectively absorb NH$_{4}$ + ions. As a result, a large amount of borate ester species, not only act as molecular-scale porogens to generate ultramicropores but serve as in-situ modifier for profitable surface functionalities, are homogeneously implanted into the carbon precursor of BG. With one-step carbonization, H$_{4}$BO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> will transform into boric-oxygenic compounds (mainly B$_{2}$O$_{3}$). Benefited from the esterification between boric acid and glucose, the formed crystals (B$_{2}$O$_{3}$) are uniform in size and well dispersed in the derived carbon, and leave ultramicropores concentrated at 0.5 nm after hot water washing. Moreover, the boric acid templating technique can endow the surface of obtained ultramicopores with abundant B-containing functionalities.

The N$_{2 }$and CO$_{2 }$adsorption-desorption analyses were used to study the influence of boric acid amount on the pore structures of the BUMCs (Fig. 1f, g and Figure S3, Supporting Information). It is observed that all the BUMCs exhibit a well-developed ultramicroporous structure as evidenced by their type-I N$_{2 }$adsorption-desorption isotherms and prominent pore distribution with size less than 0.7 nm (Fig. 1g), which is further confirmed by the CO$_{2 }$adsorption-desorption analyses (Figure S3, Supporting Information). As the molar ratio of boric acid to glucose (boric acid/glucose) increased from 0 to 1, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area increases from 557 of BUMC-0, 599 of BUMC0.2, 804 of BUMC-0.5 to 1050 m 2 g GLYPH<0> 1 of BUMC-1, respectively (Table S1). Correspondingly, their total pore volumes are calculated to be 0.216, 0.243, 0.337 and 0.445 cm$^{3 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. These results indicate that more nanopores can be produced in the resultant carbons with the increasing amount of boric acid. It is worth to note that BUMC0 also exhibit a microporous structure, which is attributed to water vapor activation during carbonization.[44] And it is observed that an appropriate boric acid/glucose ration is crucial for the construction of uniformly ultramicroporous structure in the BUMCs. As listed in Table S1, the proportion of micropore volume to total pore volume (V$_{mic}$/V$_{total}$) arrives 94.7% for BUMC-0.2, while the value gradually

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations together confirm that highly-dense yet ultramicroporous carbons have been successfully synthesized. As seen in the SEM images, all the BUMCs exhibit as highlydense bulky particles with smooth surface and large sizes ranging in 10 -100 µ m. No obvious mesopores and macropores can be observed in them (Fig. 1a, b and Figure S2, Supporting Information). As shown in the HRTEM images (Fig. 1c, d), abundant and interconnected sub-nanopores (less than 1 nm) can be clearly identified in the highly-dense BUMC-0.5 (0.5 refers to the molar ratio of boric acid to glucose). High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and the corresponding energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images tell that C, O, N and B elements co-exist and distribute uniformly in an overlapping manner within the entire BUMC-0.5 particle (Fig. 1e), demonstrating the homogenous incorporation of heteroatoms into carbon framework.

Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of boric acid templating preparation of BUMC. Borated glucose (BG) precursor was firstly synthesized by a controlled esterification reaction between boric acid and glucose under alkaline condition (reactions ① , ② and ③ ) in which the molecular template of H$_{4}$BO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> can be homogeneously implanted into the BG. Finally, the carbon product of BUMC, featured with uniform ultramicropores and abundant B, O-containing surface functionalities, was obtained by one-step carbonization of BG followed by washing with hot water.

decreases to 91.7% for BUMC-0.5 and 83.6% for BUMC-1. The possible reason is that excess boric acid will accumulate during carbonization, then crystallize and grow into larger boric-oxygenic compounds crystals, thus leading to the formation of large pores in BUMCs after washing out the templates. Our speculation is supported by both the CO$_{2 }$pore size evolutions of BUMCs (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and their

gradually decreased compaction densities with the increasing addition of boric acid (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Significantly, the increase of ultramicropores becomes inconspicuous when the boric acid/ glucose ratio is more than 0.5.

To investigate the pore formation mechanism of as-prepared carbons, the textural properties of carbon products before and after

washing with boiling water were compared. As seen in Fig. 1h, the BUMC-0.5-U (unwashed) shows a non-porous structure, in sharp contrast with the well-developed ultramicroporous structure in BUMC0.5 (washed). It demonstrates that the ultramicropores are formed immediately in the final carbon product after washing out the thermally evolved boric-oxygenic compounds with boiling water. Moreover, we compared the pore structures of as-prepared BUMC-0.5 with the control sample without adding ammonium hydroxide (denoted as BUMC-0.5-N) by N$_{2 }$ adsorption -desorption analyses. As displayed in Figure S5, a uniform microporous structure is exclusively generated in the BUMC-0.5 and BUMC-0.5-N. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of BUMC-0.5-U is shown Figure S6 (Supporting Information), where two weak peaks attributed to the (111) and (310) planes of cubic B$_{2}$O$_{3 }$ are observed, further confirms the existence of B$_{2}$O$_{3 }$ nanocrystals which behave as self-templating porogens.[35] Due to the lattice contraction caused by B doping, the BUMC-0.5 exhibits a right-shift of (002) peak of graphite in the XRD patterns in contrast to that of the control sample without B doping (BUMC-0).[45] Moreover, as depicted by Raman spectra in Figure S7 (Supporting Information), more structural defects are generated in the BUMCs.

As illustrated in Scheme 1, our boric acid templating technique can provide another merit to endow carbon ultramicropores with abundant B-containing surface functionalities. To prove this point, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surface chemistries of BUMCs (Fig. 2 and Figure S8, Supporting Information). With the increasing addition of boric acid, the B content of carbon products gradually increases from 0 to 1.63 at.%, which leading to remarkable ascending of oxygen contents in them (Table S1). As depicted by the deconvoluted O 1 s spectrum of BUMC-0.5 (Fig. 2b), it contains three O species: = O (531.6 eV), GLYPH<0> O GLYPH<0> (532.7 eV) and chemisorbed oxygen or water (534 eV). Resolving the N 1 s spectrum of BUMC-0.5 gives four individual component peaks centered at 398.8, 399.9, 401.0, and 403.1 eV that can be corresponded to pyridone N (N GLYPH<0> 6), pyrrolic N (N -5), quarternary N (N -Q), and oxidized pyridinic N (N -X), respectively (Fig. 2c).[46] The incorporated N species are attributed to the addition of NH$_{3}$ · H$_{2}$O in the synthesis of BG precursor. Moreover, high-resolution B 1 s spectra (188 -195 eV region) of BUMC-0.5 were deconvoluted to clarify the B-bonding forms that introduced into the carbon skeleton

(Fig. 2d). Two main peaks at 191.1 and 192.0 eV are assigned to -BC$_{2}$O and -BCO$_{2 }$groups, respectively. Additionally, the peak at around 190.2 eV was associated to BC$_{3}$-like groups, and the one centered at 193.0 eV was corresponded to B$_{2}$O$_{3 }$species.[47] Given the merits of molecularlevel distribution of borate ester species implemented in our technique, these B-containing groups should be homogeneously grafted on the surface of ultramicropores. As shown in Fig. 2e and Table S2 (Supporting Information), the contents of -BCO$_{2}$, B-C and -BC$_{2}$O in BUMCs increase gradually with the growing of boric acid, when the boric acid/ glucose ratio exceeds 0.5, suggesting the evolution of B doping.[48] According to the XPS results mentioned above, the typical heteroatom species in BUMC-0.5 are summarized in Fig. 2f.

## 3.2. Electrochemical performance of BUMCs electrodes

It is reported that higher charge storage efficiency in carbon nanopores can be achieved when their pore sizes are approaching to that of the electrolyte ions.[49] Given the fact that the ion diameter of desolvated SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> (~0.47 nm)[50] is close to the most portable pore size of BUMCs (0.4 -0.6 nm), 1 M H$_{2}$SO$_{4 }$solution was chosen as the electrolyte for the three-electrode supercapacitor measurements. Fig. 3a and Figure S9 (Supporting Information) show the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of BUMC-0.2, BUMC-0.5 and BUMC-1 electrodes at scan rates of 5 to 100 mV s GLYPH<0> 1 in a potential window between GLYPH<0> 0.2 and 0.8 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE), which exhibit a distorted rectangular-like shape with apparent hump peaks, indicating coexistence of EDLC and pseudo-capacitance (pseudo-C) induced by various functional groups.[51] The contributions of EDLC and pseudo-C in these carbon electrodes have been analyzed by the Trasatti method, [52] which can be found in Figure S10 (Supporting Information). In contrast, a triangle-shaped CV curve is found for the BUMC-0 electrode (Figure S9, Supporting Information), indicating poor accessibility of electrolyte ions.[53] At a high scan rate of 100 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, no apparent distortion is observed for the CV curve of BUMC-0.5, suggesting its excellent rate performance. The galvanostatic charge -discharge (GCD) curves of the BUMC-0.5 are also displayed in Fig. 3b, which show nearly symmetric and linear charge/discharge profiles, manifesting its superior capacitive characters.

(i) Schematic diagram of the entrance and transmission processes of hydrated SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> in the ultramicropore of BUMC-0.5.

Fig. 3c shows the gravimetric and volumetric specific capacitances ( C$_{wt }$ and C$_{vol}$ ) versus current density in 0.1 -20 A g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. The C$_{wt }$ at 0.1 A g GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$of BUMC-0.5 and BUMC-1 calculated from the discharge curve are 266 and 215 F g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively, much higher than that of BUMC-0 and BUMC-0.2. Thanks to the high packing density (1.62 g cm GLYPH<0> $^{3}$) of BUMC0.5, an ultrahigh C$_{vol }$ of 431 F cm GLYPH<0> $^{3 }$is achieved in it, significantly higher than that in representative carbon materials such as activated carbons (AC), templated carbons (TC), biomass-derived carbons (Bio-C), graphene-based carbons (GR), and polymer-derived carbons (PC) reported in literatures (Fig. 3d and Table S3, Supporting Information). Despite of its high density and extremely-confined ultramicroporous channels, the BUMC-0.5 exhibits an exceptional high capacitance retention of 77% as the current density increasing from 1 to 20 A g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. Such extraordinary rate performance is rarely reported in ultramicroporous carbon electrodes (Fig. 3e and Table S4, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the capacitance per unit surface area of BUMC-0.5 electrode is calculated to be 27.0 μ F cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$at 0.5 A g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, representing the highest value in typical ultramicroporous carbons as far as we know (Fig. 3f and Table S5, Supporting Information). To reveal the underlying mechanism of the improved electrochemical performance, the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out (Fig. 3g and Figure S11). The smallest semicircle diameters in high frequency region of BUMC-0.5 shows the lowest impedance of charge-transfer process, demonstrating its excellent ionic conductivity.

Moreover, BUMC-0.5 exhibits the steepest slope in the low-frequency region, suggesting the rapid ion diffusion and transport kinetic in the ultra-micropores originated from its uniformly B-based groups on the pore surface.

The above results clearly demonstrate an accessible and fast ion transport in this dense yet ultramicroporous BUMC-0.5, which represents an anomalous electrochemical behavior in nano-confined carbon channels.[13 -15] In general, the carbon materials with small pores, especially ultramicropores, are commonly encountered with slow ion diffusion kinetics and low pore utilization efficiency due to the steric hindrance and extreme confinement effects.[54,55] This is also supported by our controlled experiment, where a low capacitance and a poor rate capability is found for the BUMC-0 (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The enormous contrast of supercapacitive performance between BUMC-0.5 and BUMC-0 implies the prominent role of surface N and B functionalities on the ion diffusion kinetics in ultramicropores. Considering the fact that N-Q is the major N species in BUMC-0.5 (Fig. 2c and Table S2, Supporting Information), which can improve its electronic conductivity, B-containing functional groups are rationally recognized as the key factor for ion transportation. Previous studies have evidenced that B doping could give rise to surface polarization of carbon framework and thus enhance its surface wettability toward aqueous electrolyte,[20] thus favoring ionic accessibility to the carbon surface and improving ionic diffusion in internal ultramicropores. To further

elucidate the effects of different B-containing functionalities, firstprinciples simulation based on the density functional theory (DFT) method was performed. The results show that the SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> adsorption energies on -BC$_{3}$, -BC$_{2}$O, and -BCO$_{2 }$species are 72.3, 79.5, and 94.8 kJ mol GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. In sharp contrast, the adsorption energy at pristine carbon surface is only 19.6 kJ mol GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$(Fig. 3h), which demonstrates the role of B doping in the enhancement for SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> adsorption, Notably, the -BCO$_{2 }$ group would be the most suitable B doped surfaces due to the highest Δ E$_{a }$to SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> . Since the SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> ion prefers the positively charged site, its adsorption strength is highly correlated to the electron density near the adsorption site. On the other hand, the calculated hydration energy of SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> is 6.99 kJ mol GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which is much lower than the SO$_{4}$2 GLYPH<0> adsorption energies on B-doped substrates. Moreover, considering the fact that the hydrated SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> (~0.67 nm) is larger than the pore size of BUMCs (0.4 -0.6 nm), we speculate that these B-containing functional groups play an important role in promoting the adsorption and desolvation of SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> after which the dehydrated SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> ions are capable of entering the ultramicropores. Furthermore, with the assistance of applied voltage and these favorable pore surface functionalities, rapid ion transportation in these ultramicroporous channels can be implemented.[56] Above all, the B-containing groups on the surface of ultramicropores can promote the adsorption and desolvation of SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> and rapid ion transportation in these ultramicropores, as illustrated in Fig. 3i.

Benefitting from its high specific capacitance of 145 F cm GLYPH<0> $^{3 }$and the wide operating voltage, the BUMC-0.5//BUMC-0.5 symmetrical

In order to explore the practical application of as-prepared carbon materials, a symmetric supercapacitor based on BUMC-0.5 electrode was assembled. As revealed by Fig. 4a and b, the device can be well operated at a high potential window of up to 2.0 V in neutral electrolyte (1 M Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$) with excellent charge -discharge performance and rate capability. At a current density of 5 A g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, the device displays an ultralong high-power cycling lifespan with 83% capacitance retention over 12,000 cycles (Fig. 4c), representing a high-level cycling stability for compact carbon-based supercapacitors in aqueous electrolyte. As shown in Figure S13 and S14, BUMC-0.5 remains the stable ultramicroporous structure and excellent cycling stability after the long-term cycles of charge -discharge.

supercapacitor delivers a maximum energy density of 32.6 Wh L GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$at a power density of 405 W L GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. To the best of our knowledge, it is amongst the highest volumetric energy densities of carbon materials in aqueous electrolytes and significantly higher than those of typical compact carbons (Fig. 4d).[57 -72] Furthermore, as exhibited in Fig. 4e, a miniature fan can be powered by two asymmetric supercapacitors connected in series, manifesting its potential for practical application.

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, we prepared highly-dense yet ultramicroporous carbons with boron/oxygen-enriched surface functionalities by using a unique boric acid templating technique, where the boric acid not only acts as molecular-scale template for the formation of ultramicropores but also serves as in-situ modifier for implantation of profitable functional groups. The addition of ammonia is crucial for the esterification reaction between boric acid and glucose, which lays the foundation for homogeneously implanting of borate ester species into the crosslinked precursor of borated glucose. Our results demonstrated that an unprecedented high volumetric supercapacitive performance can be realized in such compact ultramicroporous carbons. Theoretical and experimental efforts reveal that B-containing groups ( -BC$_{2}$O and -BCO$_{2 }$ etc.) on the channel walls can facilitate the electrolyte ion transport in such nanoconfined spaces, thus leading to high-efficiency utilization of ultramicropores for capacitive charge storage. Our work opens an avenue for designing new artificial nanochannels and advances the development of confined mass transport technologies. Further optimization of pore architecture and surface chemistry in such carbons is underway to pursue more compact energy storage. Furthermore, our preparation technique can be simply operated at mild conditions with rich natural raw resources and low cost, representing its good economic feasibility and environmental friendliness.
