## 1. Introduction

Hydrogen evolution from electrochemical water-splitting (HER) has been vigorously pursued as an attractive rout to mitigate the dependence on fossil fuels [1,2]. Nevertheless, owing to the high energy consumption for both water dissociation and hydrogencoupled electron transfer in HER, the total electrolysis efficiency is limited and seriously insufficient [3,4]. In this regard, developing efficient electrocatalysts possessing sufficient water and proton adsorption sites is essential to the substantial advance of HER. Till now, precious platinum-based materials with high activity are still the dominantly used catalysts. However, the finite source and high cost significantly impede their commercial utilization in scalable hydrogen production.

Very recently, cost-efficient molybdenum carbide (Mo$_{2}$C) has been considered as an adorable candidate for its Pt-like electronic

structures [5-7]. The adequately unoccupied 4 d orbitals endow the Mo$_{2}$C with potential activation ability towards both the water and proton in HER process. Nevertheless, despite considerable research, the HER activity of Mo$_{2}$C is intrinsically limited by the high density of empty valence band, and the strong H-adsorption energy, which restricts the desorption of generated H$_{2}$ [8-10]. For Mo$_{2}$C, the valence band nearby the Fermi level is primarily composed by the d orbitals of Mo atom [11,12]. Consequently, tunning the local environment around the Mo atom can influence the valence band of catalyst significantly [13,14]. Take the consideration of different d orbitals structure, introducing the secondary metal, such as Ni, Co, and Fe, is feasible to adjust the local environment around the Mo atom, which may reform the band structure and weaken the hydrogen adsorption, thus promoting the HER kinetics of Mo$_{2}$C [15,16]. However, the metal dopants usually suffer from active sites dissolution during electrolysis, especially under acidic condition, leading to the decay of electrolytic efficiency in HER. Moreover, as the active catalyst, the aforementioned metal will also promote the generation of conducted carbon such as carbon nanotube rather than the carbides, thus reducing the intrinsic activity for HER [17,18].

In contrast, the nonmetallic elements (e.g., N, S, and P) doping is emerging as another suitable option, which may strengthen the p -d hybridization, thereby downshifting the valence band of Mo$_{2}$C, and weakening the Mo-H strength [19]. Meanwhile, considering that the nitrogen atom owns a similar atomic radius with carbon atom, but higher electronegativity [20], N-doping is predicted as the most ideal element to vary the electronic configuration of Mo$_{2}$C. Additionally, the nitrogen doping can also specifically increase the density of atomic vacancy and disordered lattice of the Mo$_{2}$C to maximize the quantity of exposed active sites to the media, thereby facilitating the intrinsic activity in HER [21,22]. Nevertheless, the previously reported doping strategy is commonly relying on the gas-solid interfacial reaction by direct nitriding of transition metal-based materials using pure NH$_{3}$ or N-contained molecule as N source [23-25], which often leads to the aggregation of active sites and the uncontrolled dopants distribution due to the inhomogeneity of these interfacial reactions. Moreover, the open environment in gas-solid reactions also causes the serious N escape from the lattice. As a result, the direct nitridation strategy only generates the micro-doping on the surface or into carbon supports rather than carbides [26,27], resulting in limited electron or valence band regulation.

Herein, we proposed a multiscale confinement synthesis method to design the nitrogen-rich Mo$_{2}$C as the efficient HER catalyst. Different from direct nitridation of common Mo-based compound, a pre-coordination bonded polymer of molybdenum and poly triazine imide was elaborated and utilized as the precursor, in which the C, N and Mo atoms were homogeneously and microscopically limited into the well-defined nanosheet cluster. Further benefiting from the macro-confinement effect in the pressuretight tube sealing system to adjust the partial pressure of carbon and nitrogen, the nitrogen-rich Mo$_{2}$C, verified by multi fine techniques, was successfully established on the carbon substrate. The superior HER performance with the low overpotentials of - 72 and - 78 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm - 2 in alkaline and acid solution, respectively, is competitive to most progressive molybdenum-based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations portray that the remarkable activity of nitrogen-rich Mo$_{2}$C is principally attributed to high dopants concentration, for instance, the valence band remarkably down shifts to the optimized level by reason of the adequate and stronger N 2 p -Mo 4 d hybridization, which facilitates both the water dissociation and H$_{2}$ release.

The HER performance was operated in a three-electrode cell on VMP-300 (Bio-Logic, France) using the Hg/Hg$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ (0.5 M H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$)or Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) as the reference electrode. The graphite rod and glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode (5 mm in diameter) were used as the counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. The electrocatalyst ink was synthesized by dispersing 3.0 mg of sample in the mixture of distilled water (400 l L), isopropanol (100 l L), and Nafion solution (5 wt.%, 20 l L). After ultrasonication for 1 h, 20 l L of electrocatalyst ink was coated onto glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode, which is served as the working electrode. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test at a scan rate of 5 mV s - 1 was employed to portray the polarization curves. All polarization curves were further corrected by iR$_{s}$ -correction, where R$_{s}$ is denoted as the electrolyte resistance, obtained by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) experiments. The stability of catalysts was determined by both the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry tests at the current density of 10, 20 and 50 mA cm - $^{2}$.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Structure of the catalyst

The nitrogen-rich Mo$_{2}$C(N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C) was synthesized by a multiscale confinement pyrolysis method (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1)i na pressure-tight tube sealing system (Fig. S2). The pre-coordination bonded polymer of molybdenum and poly triazine imide (MoPTI) with large N content of 45.29% was elaborated according to our previous study [28] and utilized as the precursor (Figs. S3S5). Different with previously reported Mo-based composites processor [29,30], the Mo-PTI demonstrates a homogeneously and alternately atomic distribution of C, N and Mo atoms on the well-defined nanosheet cluster (Fig. S6), which may eliminate the inhomogeneity of nitriding reactions. The micro-confinement effect of pre-bonding behavior in Mo-PTI is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Specifically, C 1 s and N 1 s XPS spectra of Mo-PTI alongside with annealing treatment (Fig. S7) reveal that besides of ligand derivative carbon, the Mo-C and Mo-N bonds locating at 283.7 and 396.7 eV respectively can be detected in the products [17,31]. This striking phenomenon suggests the prebonding of C, N and Mo atoms in the Mo-PTI, as well as the alternately atomic distribution can effectively confine the Mo-C/Mo-N bonds in pyrolysis process, enabling the homogeneous doping of the N atoms into the Mo$_{2}$C lattice. For comparison, the solid mixture of PTI ligand and MoO$_{3}$ is also used as the precursor. As expected, both the Mo-C and Mo-N bond cannot be observed in the XPS spectra alongside the temperature rise (Fig. S8), which illustrate the micro-confinement effect of pre-coordination behavior in the Mo-PTI precursor.

Moreover, macro-confinement environment is generated by the released gases from the precursor decomposition, such as NH$_{3}$, HCN and CO$_{2}$ (thermogravimetric mass infrared spectrometry (TG-MS-IR), Fig. 1b-d). Consequently, the partial pressure of N,C-contained molecular can be adjusted in the pressure-tight sealing system during the annealing process, which efficiently prevents the N escape from the lattice, promoting the crystal growth. Afterwards, the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C can be obtained by a one-step pyrolysis at 850 ° C in the tube sealing. The successful preparation of N$_{h}$Mo$_{2}$C is firstly confirmed by the XPS analysis. Fig. 2(a) shows the Mo 3 d high resolution XPS spectrum of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C. The typical characteristic peaks of Mo-C bonds in Mo$_{2}$C lattice are observed at 231.1 and 228.0 eV, and two peaks located at 232.1 and 228.9 eV indicate the presence of Mo-N bond in the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C [32]. Remarkably, the high N-Mo bond concentration in carbide lattice can be

calculated as 25%, which is much larger than that of previous study [22,33,34]. The etched Mo 3 d high resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. S9) reveals a similar mole ratio of Mo-N and Mo-C bonds, indicating that this high N content is homogeneously distributed throughout whole carbide lattice of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C rather than the surface.

To confirm the specificality of the proposed multiscale confinement strategy, the pyrolysis process also conducted under Ar flow (the resulted sample is donated as N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C). As predicted, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C only demonstrates quite weak Mo-N bond in the Mo 3 d high resolution XPS spectrum, manifesting strong nitrogen fixation ability of multiscale confinement synthesis method. The N 1 s high resolution XPS spectra testify the similar results. As illustrated in the Fig. 2(b), besides of the peaks at 394.6, 397.9 and 399.6 eV ascribing to the Mo 3 p , pyridinic N and pyrrolic N respectively, the N 1 s profiles also exhibit a prominent singlet at 396.2 eV, represented as the N-Mo bond in N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C [35,36]. For comparison, the N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C testify the little signal of this N-Mo bond. The C 1 s spectra of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C are displayed in the Fig. 2(c). As expected, both show the typical characteristic peak at 283.7 eV indexing to the C-Mo bond, suggesting the formation of Mo$_{2}$C lattice. The rest three peaks centered at 284.8, 285.9 and 288.5 eV can be assigned to C-C/C=C, C-N/C=N and C-O bonds [7,37,38], respectively (detailedly fitted data of XPS spectra are shown in Tables S1-S4).

To probe the local environment of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis were further conducted. Fig. 2(d) exhibits the normalized XANES spectra at K-edge of the synthesized N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C and the reference N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C. Apparently, N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C illustrates the highest energy of absorption edge, indicating the richer Mo-N bond in N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C lattice efficiently adjust the local environment around the Mo atom, which thus change the valence band and corresponding chemical adsorption of H$_{2}$/H$_{2}$O in HER. Subsequently, the Fourier transform magnitudes of EXAFS spectra in R

space is performed to obtain deeper insight into the structural nature of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C. As shown in Fig. 2(e), N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C reveals a similar spectrum with N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 Å, indicating that an alike crystal structure of the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C. Beyond that, the lower shift of first and second peaks at around 1.44 and 2.62 Å (the fitted spectra are shown in the Fig. S10), and variant of peaks intensity are also observed in the spectrum of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C as compared with the N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C, which implies that the higher N 2 p -Mo 4 d hybridization strongly affects the atomic configuration. Subsequently, the coordination numbers of Mo-N and Mo-C in N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C are fitted as 0.7 and 2.4, respectively (Table S5), which is close to the XPS results, also suggesting the high N concentration in carbide lattice of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C. The contour plots of wavelet transform (WT) displays a more clearly result. As illustrated in Fig. 2(f), the two contour centers at k space originated from the Mo-Mo and Mo-C/N bonds of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C portray remarkably negative shifts from 9.1 and 5.7 Å - 1 in the spectra of N$_{l}$Mo$_{2}$C to 8.3 and 5.2 Å - $^{1}$, respectively. The decreased bond length and transformation of atomic configuration suggest that the charge distribution around the Mo atom should be reformed, which thus adjusts the valence band and H$_{2}$/H$_{2}$O adsorption ability of catalyst.

For better understanding the occupied electronic states of N$_{h}$Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C, the highly surface-sensitive valence bandXPS spectra are conducted. As illustrated in the Fig. 2(g), compared with N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C, the valence band maximum of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C shifts away the Fermi-level from 0.15 to 0.29 eV, suggesting a subsequent downshift of the valence band. Because the valence electrons closely to the Fermi level primarily contribute the d orbitals [39,40], the shift of the valence band implies the similar tendency of d band energy level. According to the d -band theory, when d band downward shifts away the Fermi level, the affinity of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C towards hydrogen will be declined [41,42], thus reducing the resistance of hydrogen desorption, and promoting the whole alkaline HER (Fig. 2h).

The morphological and crystallographic characteristics are verified by the XRD, scanning electron microscope analysis (SEM), and transmission electron microscope analysis (TEM). The XRD patterns of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C are displayed in the Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S11. Notably, compared with the N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C, the remarkable negative shift of (002) plane and positive shift of (101) plane of b -Mo$_{2}$C (PDF#35-0787) can be obtained in XRD pattern of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, which is well matched with the previously reported Mo$_{2}$C$_{1-}$$_{x}$N$_{x}$ ( x < 0.57) solid solution [43]. Meanwhile, the declined intensity and expanded peak width at half height indicate the high N content may reform inherent atomic configuration, leading to the lower crystallinity, which further confirms the EXAFS results. The morphological information is determined by SEM and TEM analysis. As shown in the Fig. S12 and Fig. 3(b and c) the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C demonstrates the deformative nanosheet cluster morphology with rich hierarchical porous distribution due to gas expansion in high temperature. This unique structure endows the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C large specific area of 134.28 m$^{2}$g - $^{1}$(Fig. S13), implying the highly exposed active sites in the catalyst-solution interface. The superior hydrophilic ability of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C is also verified by the static contact angle anal-

is (Fig. 3d), which facilitate the fast mass and charge exchange in HER.

The high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) is further applied to exhibit the atomic configuration of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C. As shown in the Fig. 3(e and f), the (100) and (002) planes are observed in both the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C, testifying the alike hexagonal crystal structure of b -Mo$_{2}$C [44,45]. However, compared with the N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C, the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C further displays the widely distributed distortion with strong lattice strain (Fig. 3g and h), which is highly consistent with the decline intensity and expanded peak width of XRD patterns. Additionally, the nonnegligible atomic vacancy can also be detected in the HRTEM image of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, demonstrating the atomic configuration of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$Cis reformed by high N content, and the local environment around the Mo atoms should be modulated. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 3i) images exhibit the homogenous distribution of C, N and Mo atoms throughout the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C structure. These results all prove the multiscale confined synthesis method can realize the high N content in the carbide lattice of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, and efficiently modulate the inherent atomic configuration and

coordination environment around the Mo atoms, therefore optimizing the HER property.

## 3.2. HER performance

HER activity is evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in both the acid and alkaline solution. All potential values are calibrated against the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) after iR correction. For comparison, the pristine Mo$_{2}$C(N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C) is prepared by annealing the mixture of Mo(acca)$_{2}$ and N doping carbon at 850 ° C under Ar atmosphere (the detailedly structural characterizations including XRD, XPS, HRTEM and BET analysis are displayed in Figs. S14-S17). Fig. 4(a) displays the LSV curves of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C in acid solution. Apparently, the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C exhibits the superior HER performance with smallest overpotential of - 78 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm - 2 ( ƞ$_{10}$ ), much smaller than that of N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C( - 155 mV) and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C ( - 229 mV). The Tafel plots are linear fitted from the LSV curves. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Tafel slope of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C is calculated as 81.1 mV dec - $^{1}$, superior to other catalysts, highlighting its fast reaction kinetics. The catalytic property of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C in alkaline solution displays the similar tendency to the acid solution. As illustrated in the Fig. 4(c and d), the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C portrays the best HER performance with much lower overpotential of

- 72 mV and Tafel value of 67.6 mV dec - $^{1}$, which is also comparable or even superior to most of previously reported Mo based HER catalysts (Table S6), indicating the efficiently valence band modulation of high content of N doping.

The long-term stability of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C is assessed by CV and chronopotentiometry measurement. It is noteworthy that N$_{h}$Mo$_{2}$C portrays the similar LSV curves (Fig. 4e and f) after 1500 CV cycles in both acid and alkaline solution (Fig. S18). Moreover, chronopotentiometry measurement of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C reveals that the cathode potential demonstrates negligible change after at least 72 h catalytic process at the current density of 10, 20 and 50 mA cm - $^{2}$, indicating that the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C maintains its intrinsic HER activity (Fig. 4g and h). Sequentially, the SEM image, XRD pattern and XPS spectra after electrocatalysis reveal that N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C retains its morphology, crystal structure and chemical states, indicating the structure stability of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C in the HER (Fig. S19 and Fig. S20).

To gain insight into the nature of electrocatalytic activity, double layer capacitance ( C$_{dl}$ ) is measured from the cyclic voltammogram method between 0.2 and 0.4 V to assess exposed active site numbers (Fig. S21). The slope curves of molybdenum nitride materials are presented in Fig. S21a. The C$_{dl}$ of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C is calculated as 6.4 mF cm - 2 which is nearly 1.7-fold higher than that of N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C (3.7 mF cm - $^{2}$), suggesting that the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C exposes more active

sites at the catalyst-liquid interface, thus enhancing HER performance. The electron, charge and ions transfer resistances of catalyst are assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. S22 displays the obtained Nyquist plots of the asprepared molybdenum carbide materials. Notably, N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C displays the lowest charge-transfer impedance in both the alkaline and acid solution, favoring the result of the HER activity.

## 3.3. Mechanism analysis

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further carried out to elucidate the modulation essence of high N doping in valence band and H$_{2}$/H$_{2}$O adsorption. According to previous studies [46], the (001) plane of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C is used as the model surface (Fig. 5a and Figs. S23-S26 , the detailed lattice parameters are illustrated in Table S7). As demonstrated by the partial density of state (PDOS) (Fig. 5b ) , the 2 p orbital of lattice N reveals the apparent overlap with 4 d orbital of Mo below the Fermi level, suggesting the strong interactions between N and Mo atom. Therefore, the d band center for N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C is downshifted from - 2.4 to - 2.6 eV as compared with N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C. The result is highly consistent with the VB-XPS spectra, suggesting that the hydrogen adsorption energy should be weaken. The simulated work function

is presented in the Fig. S27 and Fig. 5(c). The highest transgression energy of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C also demonstrates the coincident valence band shift, and lowest constraint ability for H$_{2}$. Moreover, for better disclosing the auxo-action on H adsorption and desorption of N$_{h}$Mo$_{2}$C, the Gibbs free energies ( D G$_{H*}$ ) are also conducted. According to the previously reported study, we first calculated the D G$_{H*}$ of H atom on the Mo site on the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C (Fig. S28). The results (Fig. 5d) reveal that compared with N$_{l}$Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C, the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C portrays the most satisfactory H adsorption energy due to the downshift of valence band and d band center. This appearance demonstrates that the higher content of N doping efficiently modulates the H coupling and H$_{2}$ release, thus promoting the whole HER process.

Additionally, the H$_{2}$O dissociation on N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$Mo$_{2}$C are also simulated. Deformation charge density associated with Bader charge analysis of H$_{2}$O*/N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, H$_{2}$O*/N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and H$_{2}$O*/N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C are presented in the Fig. 5(e) and Fig. S29. Apparently, more charges will be migrated from H-O bonds to O-Mo bonds in the surface of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, hence reducing the stability of H$_{2}$O molecular. The H$_{2}$O adsorption energies on the surface of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C are illustrated in the Fig. 5(f) and Fig. S30. On account of the sufficient nitrogen doping with emptier 4 d orbitals, N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C pronounces the higher H$_{2}$O adsorp-

tion energy ( D E$_{H2O*}$ )of - 0.91 eV than that of N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C (-0.59 eV) and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C (-0.50 eV). Further according to the transition state simulation (Fig. 5g and Fig. S31), the energy barriers for dissociating the HO-H bond are assigned as 0.32, 0.56 and 0.71 eV on the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C, N$_{l}$-Mo$_{2}$C and N$_{0}$-Mo$_{2}$C, respectively, implying that the water-dissociation is energetically convenient on the surface of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C catalyst. Meanwhile, the weaker H + and OH - adsorption energy of N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C enable the more favorable release of production. Consequently, the possible HER mechanism on the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C surface has been disclosed. Favorable adsorption ability of H$_{2}$O reduces the HO-H bonds dissociation on account of emptier 4 d orbitals. While, the lower valence band enable the satisfactory H adsorption/desorption energy, effectively facilitating both the coupling of proton and H$_{2}$ release. Multiscale confined pyrolysis method endows the synthesized N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C with satisfactory HER performance.

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, aiming to modulate the valence band of Mo$_{2}$C, a multiscale confinement pyrolysis strategy on both the micro and

macro level has been proposed to eliminate the inhomogeneous dopant distribution and suppress the lattice N escape from the synthesized Mo$_{2}$C. Specifically, the high nitrogen concentration triggers the redistribution of the coordination environment around the Mo atoms, leading to the expanded distance between valence band and Fermi level. Accordingly, the d band center is pushed down to the lower energy level, thus weaking the binding energy of produce H$_{2}$. Simultaneously, on account of the adequate and stronger N 2 p - Mo 4 d hybridization, the Mo atoms display the emptier 4 d orbital, enhancing the H$_{2}$O dissociation. Benefiting from the synergy above, the N$_{h}$-Mo$_{2}$C reveals comparable catalytic activity and stability of HER in both the alkaline and acid solution. This work presents valuable method to adjust the electronic configuration of carbide, and inspires the development of new electrocatalysts via multiscale modulation strategy.
