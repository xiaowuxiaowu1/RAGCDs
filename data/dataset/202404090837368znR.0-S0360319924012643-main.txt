## ABSTRACT

As the kinetic processes of oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in metal-air batteries are slow, developing bifunctional catalysts with high performances is an essential requirement for boosting metal-air battery application. FeCo alloy is considered an excellent bifunctional active material, its weak corrosion resistance precludes its practical use in bifunctional catalysts. In this work, through dipping and annealing operations, FeCo alloy nanoparticles are doped on the porous carbon spheres (FeCo/PCNs). Strong FeCo nanoparticle-nitrogen-doped porous carbon sphere interaction results in a noticeable improvement in electrocatalytic activity and stability. FeCo/PCNs catalyst shows impressive bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, half-wave potential (E$_{1/2}$) of 0.905 V for ORR, and overpotential of 344 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> 2 (E$_{j }$ = $_{10}$) for OER, which are better than commercial Pt/C (E$_{1/2 }$ = 0.865 V) and RuO$_{2 }$(E$_{j }$ = 10 = 351 mV) catalysts. Furthermore, the Zinc-air battery (ZABs) prepared by FeCo/PCNs catalyst (ZAB-FeCo/PCNs), exhibits high open circuit voltage (1.53 V), high power density (135 mW cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), and good long-term cycle stability, which further proves that FeCo/PCNs has excellent ORR/OER bifunctional activity. Therefore, the unique FeCo/PCNs catalyst provides a new perspective for the construction of ZABs bifunctional catalysts.

## 1. Introduction

People are paying increasing attention to the development of sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies as the global environmental issues brought on by the use of fossil fuels become more serious [1 -4]. The rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZABs) has the advantages of high theoretical energy density, environmental friendliness and good safety, and is a strong competitor for the future generation of energy equipment [5,6]. The pronouncedly slow process in air cathode present the most significant challenge for ZABs [7 -9]. The most advanced catalysts to resolve this issue for ORR and OER are Pt, Ir, and Ru [10,11]. However, the high cost and poor durability of these materials have limited their commercial deployment [12,13]. Therefore, the design of low-cost catalysts with high catalytic activity is of great

significance for the zinc-air batteries.

Transition metal N-doped carbon composites (M-N-C, M = Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) are considered to be the most likely alternative materials for precious metal catalysts due to their advantages of low cost and high activity [14 -16]. Because of the different electrical the intrinsic activity of bimetal alloys (such as FeCo [17], FeNi [18], and NiCo [19]) is significantly higher than that of single metal-based catalysts, whether for ORR or OER. Bimetallic alloy-containing N-doped carbon materials as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, in particular, are projected to outperform their single-metal counterparts. For example, by encasing FeNi alloy in nitrogenated porous carbon, Wang et al. [14] prepared a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst that exhibited an E$_{1/2 }$of 0.86 V and an overpotential of 355 mV at 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. Due to the polarity difference between the two metals in the alloy, the electron cloud in the alloy

is redistributed, the reaction energy barrier is reduced, and the catalytic activity is increased [20,21]. Despite this, alloy nanoparticles are very easy to be corroded in alkaline electrolyte, which seriously hinders their practical application [22,23].

In this study, porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres supported FeCo alloy nanoparticles (FeCo/PCNs) were prepared by nano-emulsion, impregnation, and high-temperature annealing. After embedding FeCo alloy in a porous carbon nanosphere host, it successfully prevents quick corrosion in the catalytic process, and the N atom in PCNs skeleton effectively changes the charge distribution of carbon carrier, forming a high-active site of Fe//Co-N$_{x}$. The synthesized catalyst demonstrated exceptional bifunctional activity. In the ORR test, the E$_{1/2 }$was 0.905 V, while the overpotential at 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$current density (E$_{j }$ = $_{10}$) in the OER test was 344 mV. The results were improved as compared to commercial Pt/C (E$_{1/2 }$ = 0.864 V) and RuO$_{2 }$ (E$_{j }$ = 10 = 351 mV). Furthermore, when being assembled as a zinc-air battery, FeCo/PCNs outperformed Pt/C + RuO$_{2}$, with more stable cycle performance.

It has been proven that wrapping alloy particles with a carbon layer can effectively prevent their corrosion during catalytic reactions [24, 25]. As an example, Zheng et al. reported a novel gas-phase growth strategy to encase FeNi alloy particles in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes, effectively preventing corrosion of alloy particles in alkaline electrolytes, and only a small potential difference existed after 10,000 cycles [26]. In addition, the incorporation of N element into the lattice of carbon carrier can not only change the adsorption property of matrix carbon but also improve the active site of electron cloud density regulation, thus increasing the activity of OER and ORR [27,28]. Galiote et al. found in their study that the activity of FeCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon was not improved compared with pure carbon, but the ORR activity of FeCo-NC catalyst was significantly improved after treatment with NH$_{3}$The study also shows that when M-N-C species are present in the material, the ORR polarization curve shows high half-wave potential values even at lower amounts [29]. Fe and Co can accelerate the water oxidation reaction. It has been found that after Fe is added to containing Co alloy, the current density of the material will increase and the Tafel slope will decrease. Besides, the iron ion located on the surface Co oxide is the main reactive site of the OER reaction [30]. Fe ions situated on the edges or defects of Co and Ni oxides serve as the primary active sites for water oxidation reactions, while other Fe ions contribute to increased conductivity of the oxide layer [31]. In addition, by introducing structural defects into the carbon skeleton, abundant pore-size structures can be generated to provide more reaction sites, and the carbon carrier with a large specific surface area and rich pore-size distribution has more regions to promote the growth of active substances in the preparation process [32 -34]. Peng et al. used a nano-emulsion assembly method to create extremely homogeneous N-doped porous carbon nanospheres with nanosized diameters and adjustable pore sizes [35]. The porous carbon nanospheres prepared by this method have abundant pore structure and large specific surface area, which are suitable for use as catalyst hosts.

## 2. Experimental section

## 2.1. Synthesis of the PCNs

Nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanospheres (PCNs) were prepared by reference to the reported literature [35]. First, mixed 50 mL water and 50 mL ethanol, and Fluorine-127 (F127, AR, Macklin) with a mass of 1 g and 0.5 g Dopamine hydrochloride (DA, 98%, Kermel) were ultrasonically dissolved in the mixed solution. After the solution appeared clear and transparent, 1.0 mL of Mesitylene (TMB, AR, Macklin) reagent was added drop by drop under agitation. Continue stirring reaction for 30 min, add 1.5 mL ammonium hydroxide, and then continue stirring reaction for 30 min. The resulting product was centrifuged and washed in turn with water and ethanol. The dried products were collected and calcined, first at 350 · C for 3 h, then at 800 · C for 2 h, the heating rate

was 1 · C min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, and the calcination atmosphere was Ar.

## 2.2. Preparation of the FeCo/PCNs, Fe/PCNs and Co/PCNs

To prepare the FeCo/PCNs bifunction catalyst, 0.2 mmol FeCl$_{3}$ · 6H$_{2}$O and 0.3 mmol CoCl$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O were firstly dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water and ethanol mixture (volume ratio 1:1), and then 500 mg of prepared PCNs carbon carrier and 500 mg of dicyandiamide (DCD) were added, agitated at 120 · C until the solution evaporated completely. The product is then calcined. The calcination technology is to initially heat the sample to 550 · C, keeping the temperature for 3 h, and then heat continuously to 750 · C for 1h. The collected product was named FeCo/PCNs. Besides, the Co/PCNs and Fe/PCNs catalysts for convenient comparison were also prepared without adding iron/cobalt salt.

## 2.3. Materials characterization

The catalysts are represented by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Details are provided in the "Support Information" section.

## 2.4 Electrochemical characterization

The performances of all samples were tested using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E from CH Instrument). Details are provided in the "Support Information" section.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Structure and Physicochemical characteristics

Fig. 1 illustrates the preparation process of FeCo/PCNs. The surface morphology and structure of the catalyst were observed by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Fig. 2a -d are SEM images of the prepared PCNs, Co/PCNs, Fe/PCNs, and FeCo/PCNs catalysts. It can be seen that the morphologies of PCNs are essentially spherical and porous, whereas spherical Co/PCNs, Fe/PCNs, and FeCo/ PCNs particles are randomly dispersed on the surface of PCNs. The morphology of PCNs is essentially unchanged after loaded metal particles.

XRD results of PCNS, FeCo/PCNs, Co/PCNs, and Fe/PCNS are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S1a. In the XRD pattern in Fig. 3a, the FeCo/PCNs spectra identify diffraction peaks at 44.8 · , 65.3 · , and 82.5 · , corresponding to the (110), (200), and (211) crystal faces of the bodycentered cubic FeCo alloy, which correspond to the lattice fringes identified in the TEM. In Fig. S1a, three peaks at 44.6 · , 65.0 · , and 82.3 · are the (110), (200), and (211) crystal faces of Fe (JCPDS

The TEM picture of FeCo/PCNs can also show that the spherical particles loaded with metal particles have a similar morphology as the SEM image (Fig. 2d). The loaded metal particles are relatively uniform, with visible lattice stripes. In addition to the morphology described above, some carbon nanotubes (NCTs) are also dispersed on the surface of PCNs nanospheres. A previous report suggested that the formation of CNTs was mainly due to the catalytic effect of alloy nanoparticles [8]. In Fig. 2f, it can be seen that the prepared alloy has a lattice fringe of 0.21 nm, which can be attributed to the (110) planes of the FeCo alloy, and the FeCo alloy particles are surrounded by a carbon layer. As seen from the correlation EDS diagram in Fig. 2g -C and N elements are evenly distributed in the carbon sphere, and the relatively uniform FeCo alloy nanoparticles are distributed on the surface of the carbon sphere. ICP is used to determine the content of Fe and Co in the FeCo/PCNs, the results are shown in Table S3. In the as-prepared catalyst, the content of Fe is 3.15% and Co is 5.22%.

PDF#06 -0696), while Co/PCNs show three main peaks of 36.5 · , 42.3 · , and 61.5 · , are the (111), (200) and (220) crystal faces of CoO (JCPDS PDF#17 -4027).

Raman and BET tests were used to further investigate the intrinsic structure and pore size distribution of the samples. Fig. 3b and Fig. S1b show the Raman spectra of all samples, which show significant signals at 1590 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$(G) and 1340 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$(D). The I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$values of FeCo/PCNs, Fe/

PCNs, Co/PCNs, and PCNs were 0.84, 0.90, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively. Indicating the FeCo/PCNs catalyst has a higher degree of graphitization and higher conductivity. As a result, it predicts that FeCo/PCNs catalyst will have much higher conductivity. The BET results of all catalysts are shown in Figs. S2a and b. Type IV hysteresis loops are seen in all samples, indicating that the samples have mainly mesoporous structures. The specific surface areas of FeCo/PCNs, Fe/PCNs, Co/PCNs, and PCNs

were 695.36148, 695.35123, 645.42627, and 749.48208 m 2 g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. The pore size distribution of all samples is shown in Fig. S2b, the pore size of all samples distributed between 2.9 and 3.9 nm, which corresponds to Fig. S2a.

To explore the chemical element composition of the catalyst, XPS measurement for FeCo/PCNs was further conducted. Fig. 3c is the N 1s spectra of FeCo/PCNs, the peaks at 398.2, 399.5, 401, 404.2, and 406.5 eV are attributed to pyridine-N, Fe/Co -N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N [36]. Usually, pyridinic-N can readily react with metals to form the catalytic active site of M-N$_{x}$, while graphitic-N can increase electrical conductivity to hasten electron transport [37,38]. It is noteworthy that Fe/Co-N$_{x }$are recognized as catalytic sites with outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen reduction [27]. As depicted in Fig. 3d, FeCo/PCNs ' s Fe 2p spectrum shows that binding energy peaks of Fe 0 and Fe-N$_{x }$ are positioned at 708.8/716.3 eV and 710.7/723.2 eV, respectively. The satellite peaks are assigned around 713.4 and 731.8 eV [39]. Similarly, the six peaks in the Co 2p spectrum of FeCo/PCNs (Fig. 3e) centered at 779.4/794.8 eV, 782.2/796.9eV, and 785.8/801.7 eV correspond to the characteristic peaks of Co$^{0}$, Co-N$_{x }$and two satellite peaks [40]. Fe-N$_{x }$and Co-N$_{x }$are recognized as highly active ORR sites [39]. Fig. 3f shows the C1s spectrum of FeCo/PCNs, three characteristic peaks mainly distributed to the C -C, C -N/C -O, and π -π * [41].

## 3.2. Electrocatalytic performance for ORR

The ORR performances of all catalysts are performed in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a -Fig. S3a-d show the CV measurements of FeCo/PCNs, PCNs, Fe/ PCNs, Co/PCNs, and Pt/C, respectively. All samples showed noticeable decrease peaks at O$_{2 }$ saturation compared to N$_{2 }$ saturation. Fig. 4b shows the double-layer capacitance (C$_{dl}$) of all samples. The complete test images are shown in Figs. S4a -e. FeCo/PCNs (29.46 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$) exhibits the largest C$_{dl }$ compared with Pt/C (15.46 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), Fe/PCNs (12.95 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), Co/PCNs (13.74 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$) and PCNs (8.52 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), and the ECSA values of FeCo/PCNs, Pt/C, Fe/PCNs, Co/PCNs, and PCNs are 51.93 cm$^{2 }$mg GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 27.25 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 22.75 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 24.25 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, and 15.03 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, indicating FeCo/PCNs has much more active sites than others. LSV measurements were performed in an O$_{2}$-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution (Fig. 4c). The LSV curves in Fig. 4c was used to calculate the E$_{1/2 }$and kinetic limiting current density of all catalysts (Fig. 4d), as

well as the comparison of the Tafel slope (Fig. 4e). In Fig. 4d, the E$_{1/2 }$ and J$_{k }$ at 0.85V for all samples are compared, in which FeCo/PCNs exhibited the highest E$_{1/2 }$(0.905 V) compared with Pt/C (0.864 V), Co/ PCNs (0.833 V), Fe/PCNs (0.845 V) and PCNs (0.801 V). The ORR activity of FeCo/PCNs in 0.5 M H$_{2}$SO$_{4 }$is shown in Fig. S5. In acidic electrolytes, FeCo/PCNs catalyst exhibits a E$_{1/2 }$of 0.78 V despite it is slightly smaller than Pt/C (0.8 V). At the same time, the Tafel slope of FeCo/ PCNs (91.86 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) is the smallest compared with FePCNs (138.28 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), CoPCNs (149.68 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), PCNs (358.78 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) and Pt/C (117.72 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), which further proves that the ORR kinetic process of FeCo/PCNs is availably improved. According to Table S1, the activity of FeCo/PCNs is comparable to recently reported non-precious metal catalysts. In Fig. 4f, the LSV curves of FeCo/PCNs in the speed range of 400 -2000 rpm are shown, and its electron transfer number (n) is calculated by the K-L equation, which is shown in the illustration of Fig. 4f. The obtained value of n is close to 4, indicating that the 4e GLYPH<0> process plays a dominant role in the oxygen reduction reaction of FeCo/ PCNs. In addition, RRDE tests were conducted on FeCo/PCNs. As shown in Fig. S8, FeCo/PCNs showed a low hydrogen peroxide yield and an electron transfer number close to 4. The impedance results of FeCo/ PCNs, Pt/C PCNs, Fe/PCNs, and Co/PCNs are shown in Fig. 4g and Fig. S7. It can be seen that FeCo/PCNs have the smallest semicircle diameter among all catalysts, signifying a lower electrochemical impedance. Consequently, the FeCo/PCNs catalyst has a faster charge transfer rate during oxygen reduction catalysis, which also means that it has a faster oxygen reduction Faradaic process [42].

The durability of the catalyst is an important factor that will affect its practical application. The catalytic stability of FeCo/PCNs and Pt/C was measured by chronoamperometry (CA) in Fig. 4h. Compared with Pt/C (69.5%), FeCo/PCNs showed a relatively higher current retention of 90.2% after 15000 s of testing. Fig. 4i is the LSV curve comparison before and after 4000 times accelerated CV tests for FeCo/PCNs. There is only a 12 mV decrease of E$_{1/2 }$after the test.

## 3.3. Electrocatalytic performance for OER

Besides ORR, OER was performed in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a is the OER polarization curves of FeCo/PCNs, Fe/PCNs, Co/PCN, PCNs, and RuO$_{2}$. The comparison of the Tafel slope in Fig. 5b is carried out based on the

calculation from the date of Fig. 5a. The bar chart in Fig. 5c is a comparison of E$_{j }$ = $_{10}$, and the line chart is a comparison of the Tafel slope. In Fig. 5c, FeCo/PCNs has the smallest E$_{j }$ = $_{10 }$(344 mV) and Tafel slope 74.42 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$among RuO$_{2 }$ (351 mV, 109.26 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), Fe/PCNs (521 mV, 114.41 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), Co/PCNs (405 mV, 140.88 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), and PCNs (561 mV, 146.67 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$). Table S2 compares FeCo/PCNs catalysts with recently reported non-precious metal catalysts. FeCo/PCNs catalyst shows comparable or even better performance. In addition, the OER activity of individual PCNs was very low, but the OER activity was significantly improved with the cooperation of FeCo alloy. As previously reported, FeCo alloy embedded in PCNs skeleton can adjust the electronic structure of the host, promote charge transfer between Fe and Co components, and form hydroxide on the alloy surface to enhance OER activity. As shown in Fig. 5d and Fig. S9, FeCo/PCNs has the smallest semicircular diameter, indicating that it has the smallest impedance, which further proves that FeCo alloy can effectually promote charge transfer after incorporation into PCNs skeleton. Fig. 5d presents a comparison of the LSV curves for FeCo/PCNs, assessed both before and following 4000 consecutive CV. The absence of discernible degradation

in the curves suggests that FeCo/PCNs maintain a remarkable level of durability. After the stability experiment, the material was analyzed by TEM and ICP, and results are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S4. It was found that the morphology of the catalyst remained essentially unchanged. And the mass fraction of Fe and Co in the catalyst is 2.52% and 4.17%, respectively. The content of Fe and Co exhibited a slight reduction compared to Table S3. This can probably be attributed to the dissolution of some nanoparticles that were not encapsulated by the graphitized carbon during the catalytic process. In addition, the total voltage gap between the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction ( Δ E = E$_{j }$ = $_{10 }$- E$_{1/2}$) was used to estimate the ORR/OER bifunctional activity of the catalyst. As depicted in Fig. 5f, Δ E of FeCo/PCNs is 0.669 V, lower than precious metal catalyst (0.717 V), indicating that FeCo/ PCNs have excellent bifunctional activity [43]. The FeCo/PCNs catalysts show excellent electrocatalytic activity for catalyzing ORR and OER. For ORR, the Fe and Co combined with pyridinic-N at the edge of the graphite structure to form Fe/Co-N$_{x}$, which is considered as active site for oxygen reduction [20]. For OER, the Fe 3 + /Co 3 + active site derived from Fe$^{0}$/Co$^{0 }$can accelerate the formation of key intermediates (*OOH)

associated with OER activity. The formed FeOOH/CoOOH is considered as active site for oxygen evolution. In addition, the porous structure of PCNs can also promote the exposure of electrochemically active sites on the catalyst [44].The reasons for the excellent bifunctional activity of FeCo/PCNs are summarized as follows: (a) The addition of N into PCNs host induced the rearrangement of electron clouds, promoted the chemisorption of reaction intermediates, and formed highly active Fe/Co-N$_{x }$active sites after the introduction of transition metals [45]; (b) The reaction energy barrier is reduced by the various polarity of the constituent components of FeCo alloy [20]; (c) The strong coupling between N-doped carbon nanosphere carrier and FeCo alloy nanoparticles prevents corrosion of the alloy particles during the catalytic reaction [22]. All of these characteristics of the FeCo/PCNs catalyst reciprocate to the outstanding electrochemical performance for ORR and OER.

## 3.4. Applied in Zn-air battery

Based on the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance of FeCo/ PCNs, it was further applied to Zn-air batteries. The performance of FeCo/PCNs was investigated in an electrolyte mixture of 6 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(CH$_{3}$COO)$_{2}$. As depicted in Fig. 6b, the zinc-air battery with FeCo/PCNs (1.53 V) as a catalyst has a higher open circuit voltage (OCV) than ZAB-Pt/C + RuO$_{2 }$(1.47 V). Fig. 6c shows the discharge curves at different current densities. Under all current densities, ZAB-FeCo/PCNs presents a higher discharge platform than ZAB-Pt/C + RuO$_{2}$. The power density of ZAB-FeCo/PCNs (135 mW cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$) exceeds of ZAB-Pt/C + RuO$_{2 }$ (121 mW cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$). And when ZAB-FeCo/PCNs is used as a primary battery, it has a specific capacity of 753.709 mAh g$_{Zn}$ GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which is comparable to ZAB-Pt/C + RuO$_{2 }$(748.512 mAh g$_{Zn}$ GLYPH<0> $^{1}$). The stability of the ZABs was evaluated through a constant current charge-discharge cycle (Fig. 6g). The charge and discharge voltage gap of ZAB-FeCo/pcn remains stable, while the ZAB-PtC + RuO$_{2 }$showed a significant after 180 h. Comparing the 5th and 500th cycles shown in Fig. 6f, it can be seen that the voltage

efficiency (discharge end voltage/charge end voltage) decreased by only 2% after a long cycle compared to the initial 55%. As a consequence, the FeCo/PCNs catalyst can dramatically improve the battery performance of ZAB due to its excellent ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic performance.

## 4. Conclusions

Based on the combination of nano-emulsion method, impregnation method, and high-temperature pyrolysis, FeCo/PCNs bifunctional electrocatalyst was successfully synthesized. The prepared catalyst showed the morphology of porous nanospheres with a diameter of about 200 nm, and the surface of the porous nanospheres was evenly loaded with alloy nanoparticles coated with carbon layers. Because of the synergistic action of alloy particles and Fe-N$_{x}$/Co-N$_{x}$, FeCo/PCNs catalyst showed good bifunctional performance for ORR/OER reaction (E$_{1/2 }$ = 0.905 V, E$_{j }$ = 10 = 344 mV), which are better than commercial Pt/C (E$_{1/2 }$ = 0.864 V) and RuO$_{2 }$ (E $_{j }$ = 10 = 356 mV). In addition, in ZABs FeCo/PCNs bifunction electrocatalyst showed much better catalytic performance for ORR/OER reaction than commercial PtC + RuO$_{2}$. Therefore, this unique porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres supported FeCo alloy catalyst provides a new perspective for the construction of ZABs bifunctional catalysts, meanwhile, it can also be extended to other fields, including fuel cell, electrolysis, and electrocatalytic reaction which involves ORR/ OER reaction.
