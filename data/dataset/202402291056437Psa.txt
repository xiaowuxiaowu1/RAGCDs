ABSTRACT: The performance of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly compromised by the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is intimately linked to the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Furthermore, understanding the mechanical behavior of SEI is crucial, as it governs its response to stress induced by volume changes, fracture, or deformation. In this study, we introduce L-glutamine (Gln) as an additive to regulate the adsorbed environment of the EDL and in situ produce a hybrid SEI consisting of ZnS and Gln-related species. The results of the nanoindentation test indicate that the hybrid SEI exhibits

a low modulus and low hardness, alongside exceptional shape recovery capability, which effectively limits side reactions and enables topological adaptation to volume fluctuations in zinc anodes during zinc ion plating/stripping, thereby enabling Zn// Zn symmetric cells to exhibit an ultralong cycle life of 4000 h in coin cells and a high cumulative capacity of 18,000 mA h in pouch cells. More importantly, the superiority of the formulated strategy is further demonstrated in Zn//NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ full cells at different N/P ratios of 5.2, 4.9, 3.5, and 2.4. This provides a promising approach for future interfacial modulation in aqueous battery chemistry.

T he aqueous zinc - metal batteries (AZMBs) are widely recognized as one of the most promising alternative energy storage technologies to Li-ion batteries (LIBs), owing to their high theoretical capacity of 820 mAh g - $^{1}$, abundant resources, and low cost. 1 - 6 However, the unstable anode - electrolyte interface (AEI) in aqueous electrolytes leads to continuous water-induced side reactions (such as hydrogen evolution and corrosion), resulting in significant irreversibility and a short lifespan of the Zn anode ( Figure 1 a). 2 , 3 , 7 - 10 During the cycle, the unstable AEI is easily separated from the dynamic metal surface or fractures, and the exposed fresh zinc metal will continue to react with the hydrolysate to form a passivation layer interface ( Figure 1 a). Consequently, the AEI was thick and loose. Excessive zinc loss leads to low Coulombic efficiency and unsatisfactory cycling performance. Additionally, zinc ions preferentially deposit on bulges or ruptures in the zinc surface, causing dendrite growth. Dendrites not only result in dead zinc formation during cycling but also puncture the separator and cause short circuits.

Currently, the focus is on promoting the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) phase on the zinc anode to inhibit related side reactions. 2 , 3 , 11 This approach is inspired by the

successful formation of the SEI on lithium-ion battery anodes. However, unlike organic solvents, reduction and oxidation products of H$_{2}$O cannot directly contribute to SEI formation. 12 Therefore, additional additives need to be introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to promote SEI formation. 12 Furthermore, the formation of the SEI is intricately linked to the electrical double layer (EDL) structure at AEI since various electrochemical or chemical reactions occur there, including zinc deposition/dissolution and undesired side reactions. 2 , 7 , 13 Therefore, the introduction of additives to regulate the structure of the EDL is a crucial factor in achieving an ideal SEI.

In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to development of effective additives that can facilitate the

spontaneous formation of a robust inorganic or organic - inorganic hybrid SEI during battery cycling, such as saccharin

anions, 2 N , N -dimethylformamidium trifluoromethanesulfonate, 3 12-crown-4 ether, 14 carbon dioxide, 15 lithium bis-

(oxalate)borate, 16 etc. These approaches hold great promise in terms of enabling commercial applications by circumventing complex preparation procedures, excessive weight, and high manufacturing costs. According to prior studies, the ideal SEI must possess not only superior chemical attributes but also robust mechanical characteristics. However, despite numerous claims regarding the high strength and toughness of the SEI developed in various studies, it is important to acknowledge that its high strength and rigidity result in limited deformation ability and an inability to adapt to volume changes of the zinc anode. Therefore, the construction of a stable SEI should not be obsessed with the pursuit of high hardness and rigidity but should consider the compatibility between the SEI and zinc anode. Additionally, these studies also lack the pertinent characterization of SEI mechanical properties, thereby rendering it inaccurate to solely substantiate the exceptional electrochemical properties of SEI as evidence for its outstanding mechanical attributes.

Here, we introduce low-cost L-glutamine (Gln) additives into a 2 mol L - 1 ZnSO$_{4}$ aqueous electrolyte to address the existing knowledge gap by elucidating the regulatory mechanism of the electric double layer (EDL) structure and constructing a compatible SEI with zinc anodes ( Figure 1 b). The theoretical calculations and experiments reveal that Gln molecules can effectively regulate the surface absorption environment of the EDL, resulting in a SEI composed of organic Gln and inorganic ZnS components. The SEI exhibits low modulus and hardness properties, which contribute to its exceptional topological adaptability and compatibility with the zinc anode. This allows it to maintain co-type contact with the zinc anode while inhibiting side reactions, thereby providing lasting protection for the zinc anode ( Figure 1 b). Therefore, this enables the Zn//Zn symmetric coin cells to exhibit an exceptionally long cycle life of 4000 h, while pouch cells demonstrate a high cumulative capacity of 18,000 mA h. More importantly, this strategy is also demonstrated in Zn// NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ full cells at low N/P ratios of 5.2, 4.9, 3.5, and 2.4. This strategy of in situ constructing a topologically adaptable SEI by regulating the surface absorption environment of the Zn anode demonstrates that the performance of the SEI depends not on its rigidity and hardness but rather on its ability to withstand permanent deformation, providing a promising direction for future interfacial modulation in aqueous battery chemistry.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Regulate the Adsorbed Environment of the EDL. An ideal SEI necessitates not only high ionic conductivity but also robust adhesion to the anode. 17 Additionally, the formation of SEI is closely related to the structure of the EDL. 2 , 14 Hence, we initially validated the adhesion of the additive to the zinc anode and its capacity to regulate the EDL through both theoretical calculations and experimental investigations. The chemical structure and electrostatic potential (ESP) diagram of Gln are shown in Figure S1 , which clearly indicates that the electron density is primarily concentrated on the carbonyl and amino groups. This structure contributes to preferential electrostatic interactions between Gln and the Zn surface, leading to the formation of a metal - molecular interfacial layer. 11 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were adopted to investigate the above viewpoint. Figure 2 a illustrates the adsorption energies of H$_{2}$O and Gln on the Zn(002) surface. It is observed that all Gln with different states on the Zn(002)

surface exhibit a significantly lower adsorption energy compared to H$_{2}$O, indicating their preferential adsorption on the Zn anode over H$_{2}$O. The 2D contour map in Figure 2 b and Figure S2 illustrates the electron density statistics at the interface between Gln/H$_{2}$O and the Zn(002) surface under different states. It indicates a tendency of electron transfer from Gln to the Zn surface, suggesting strong interactions between Gln and Zn. In accordance with the principles of molecular orbital theory, a reduced band gap between the LUMO and HOMO energy levels, along with a decreased LUMO level, signifies an augmented potential for electron transfer. 11 , 18 , 19 Consequently, this results in enhanced adsorption of the additive molecules onto Zn anodes. It is worth noting that Gln exhibits a smaller HOMO - LUMO gap and a lower LUMO compared to H$_{2}$O ( Figure 2 c). Therefore, this indicates that the adsorption affinity of Gln is better than that of H$_{2}$O, and it can be firmly adsorbed onto the surface of the zinc anode. Therefore, through a systematic analysis of energy levels and adsorption energies, we have determined that Gln has the potential to modify the structure of the EDL in close proximity to the Zn surface. This modification not only reduces the proportion of active H$_{2}$O on the EDL structure and suppresses side reactions but also provides a favorable adsorbed environment for the generation of a stable SEI.

Furthermore, electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) ( Figure 2 d and Figure S3 ) and differential capacitance (DC) ( Figure S4 ) were also employed to ascertain adsorption behavior. The capacitance values of the Zn electrode in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ hybrid electrolyte exhibit a significant decrease compared to those in pure ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, which can be attributed to the restructuring DEL effect resulting from the competitive adsorption behavior of large volume Gln molecules on the Zn surface and subsequent replacement of small volume H$_{2}$O molecules ( Figure S5 ). 2 , 13 , 14 To further prove the above analysis, zinc foil was immersed in a Gln water solution to investigate the adsorption behavior of Gln on the zinc surface by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The C 1s spectra ( Figure 2 e) show a noticeable decrease in the C  O signal, demonstrating the conversion of a fraction of the C  O group interacting with the Zn surface. 11 , 20 Moreover, the peaks observed in the high-resolution N 1s and Zn 2p XPS spectra ( Figure 2 f,g) provide evidence for the formation of N  Zn/O  Zn bonds between Gln and the Zn surface through amino and carbonyl groups containing nitrogen and oxygen. 11 , 20 , 21 These facts further prove that Gln tightly adsorbs onto the Zn surface through strong coordination and electrostatic interactions between the zinc surface and amino or carbonyl groups. The above analysis shows that the additive can tightly adsorb onto the zinc surface, regulating the EDL structure and creating an optimal environment for stable SEI generation.

We further employed the ion conductivity to investigate the impact of Gln additives on the fundamental properties of electrolytes ( Figure S6 ). The ion conductivity significantly decreases with an increase in Gln concentration beyond 300 mM, suggesting that excessive Gln adversely affects ion transmission. Therefore, all Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte data presented in this article were obtained using a 300 mM addition. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy are powerful techniques for investigating the solvation structure of Zn 2+ ( Figure 2 h,i). As can be seen, there was no obvious difference in the FTIR and Raman spectra after adding 300 mM Gln compared to bare ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes.

(i - l) SEM images and EDS mapping of Cu foils after being tested at a current density of 1 mA cm - 2 for 100 s in ZnSO$_{4}$ and Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes.

Furthermore, the impact of varying concentrations of Gln additives on the bulk properties of the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte was further investigated using FTIR ( Figure S7 ). Some additional peaks can be observed in the range of 1500 - 1250 cm - $^{1}$, which gradually increase with an increase in concentration up to 500 mM. This can be attributed to the scissoring and wagging motion δ -(CH$_{2}$) of Gln molecules, as well as stretching vibrations of v$_{s}$ -(CO$_{2}$ $^{-}$). 22 These demonstrate the successful incorporation of Gln into the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte system. 23 However, the peak positions of v -(OH) and v -(SO$_{4}$ 2 $^{-}$) did not shift in the spectra of the electrolytes containing different concentrations of additive, indicating that the solvation structure of the electrolyte remained unchanged with varying additive concentrations. 2 , 23 , 24 Based on these analyses, we conclude that the Gln additive primarily regulates the structure of the EDL, without significantly altering bulk electrolyte properties.

Anticorrosion Effects and Zinc Deposition Behaviors. The Tafel curves ( Figure 3 a) illustrate a pronounced anticorrosion effect of the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, exhibiting a significantly lower corrosion current density of 6.64 mA cm - 2 and a higher corrosion potential of - 4.8 mV compared to pure ZnSO$_{4}$ (10.12 mA cm - $^{2}$, - 10 mV). To determine the

inhibitory effect of suppressing H$_{2}$O activity on the HER and OER, we evaluated the electrochemical stability windows for these electrolyte systems using LSV. As displayed in Figure 3 b, the introduction of Gln results in a much lower onset potential ( - 0.19 V@ - 25 mA cm - 2 vs Zn$^{2+}$/Zn) than the case without Gln ( - 0.14 V@ - 25 mA cm - 2 vs Zn$^{2+}$/Zn), indicating a suppressed hydrogen release. Additionally, the introduction of Gln results in a much higher onset potential (2.84 V@20 mA cm - 2 vs Zn$^{2+}$/Zn) than the case without Gln (2.74 V@20 mA cm - 2 vs Zn$^{2+}$/Zn), confirming the inhibited OER due to the addition of Gln additives ( Figure 3 c). The observation suggests that the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte induces increased polarization for both HER and the OER, while concurrently suppressing water decomposition. Figure 3 d displays the XRD patterns of the Zn anode immersed in ZnSO$_{4}$ and Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes after 14 days. As anticipated, the XRD pattern of Zn foil soaked in ZnSO$_{4}$ exhibits some characteristic peaks corresponding to byproducts, while no such peaks are observed in the XRD pattern of Zn foil immersed in Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes, indicating the corrosion inhibiting effect of Gln. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the SEM image. In the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte ( Figure 3 e), the surface of the zinc sheet is covered with flaked byproducts in comparison to the pristine

Zn ( Figure S8 ). Conversely, in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte ( Figure 3 f), the surface of the zinc sheet exhibits a relatively smooth and uniform appearance. This further substantiates the corrosion inhibiting effect of Gln. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Zn/Cu half cells in Figure 3 g illustrate the nucleation process of Zn 2+ in both ZnSO$_{4}$ and Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes during the initial cycle. It is evident that the Gln/ ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits a higher nucleation overpotential compared to the pure ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte. This observation aligns with the widely acknowledged understanding that a higher nucleation overpotential leads to a smaller nucleus radius, indicating an impeded Zn 2+ nucleation process that promotes the formation of uniform nuclei in the presence of Gln-containing EDL. 25 Furthermore, the impact of the deposition behavior of Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ and ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes on the Zn anode can be elucidated through chronoamperometry testing ( Figure 3 h). In pure ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, a progressively increasing current density with characteristic 2D diffusion curves is observed, indicating an augmentation in the effective electrode area. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to nonuniform nucleation leading to the formation of porous and disordered Zn deposition layers. 8 , 23 , 25 Conversely, in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, a stable and consistent 3D diffusion process is evident after an initial nucleation period of 20 s. This suggests uniform nucleation and growth as well as a constant effective electrode area facilitated by the regulatory effect of Gln on the diffusion and deposition dynamics of Zn$^{2+}$. 8 , 23 , 25 To validate the aforementioned analysis, SEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy

(EDS) mapping were further employed to characterize the distribution of nucleation on the Cu foil after plating at a current density of 1 mA cm - 2 for 100 s. In the case of the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, numerous irregular Zn nuclei were randomly dispersed on the Cu foil, potentially exacerbating dendrite growth during subsequent deposition processes ( Figure 3 i,j). Conversely, in Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes, nuclei exhibited a dense and uniform distribution, thereby promoting smooth Zn deposition ( Figure 3 k,l). We used the Arrhenius equation to calculate the activation energy for the desolvation process of Zn(H$_{2}$O)$_{6}$ 2+ in different electrolytes. In Figure S9 , Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ exhibits a lower activation energy of 54.78 kJ mol - 1 compared to ZnSO$_{4}$ (58.61 kJ mol - $^{1}$), indicating a reduced energy barrier for desolvation. 23 , 26 , 27 The above analysis provides more intuitive evidence that the reconstruction of the EDL structure with Gln has a significant effect on promoting uniform zinc deposition and inhibiting waterinduced parasitic reactions, thus creating a favorable environment for subsequent SEI formation.

Structure and Formation Mechanism of the SEI. To fully understand the positive effect of Gln on stabilizing the Zn anode, the structure and morphology of the Zn anode in both the ZnSO$_{4}$ and Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes were further investigated using SEM and ex-XRD. SEM images in Figure 4 a - d and Figure S10 illustrate the progressive changes in the morphology of electrode surfaces in Zn//Zn symmetric cells with different electrolytes during cycling at a plating capacity of 1 mA h cm - 2 and a current density of 1 mA cm - $^{2}$. In the case of the initial Zn anode cycled in a pure ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, the

surface exhibits irregularly deposited Zn platelets ( Figure S10a ). These initial irregular platelets can act as charge centers within the electric field, resulting in continuous charge accumulation due to the tip effect. This disturbance hinders Zn 2+ flux and promotes dendrite growth, exacerbating surface side reactions that ultimately impact the operational lifespan of Zn anodes. Consequently, upon subsequent plating of Zn after 20 and 50 cycles, Figure S10b and Figure 4 a demonstrate the presence of undesired flake-like protrusions with irregular morphology. However, the Zn anode in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits a relatively smooth surface devoid of dendrites both during the initial cycle and after 20/50 cycles ( Figure S10c,d and Figure 4 b). This substantiates that Gln effectively facilitates the formation of a stable interface on the Zn anode surface. The perspective can be further supported by cross-sectional SEM analysis ( Figure 4 c,d). As illustrated in Figure 4 c, the electrode surface in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte is covered with abundant clusters of loosely disordered flake-like and hexagonal byproducts of Zn dendrites, resulting in an extremely rough surface. This indicates the uncontrolled deposition of Zn and continuous side reactions between the Zn anode and ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes. In contrast, a flat and homogeneous surface morphology is achieved in the Gln/ ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, suggesting that the addition of Gln facilitates the formation of stable SEI films ( Figure 4 d). Furthermore, the chemical phase transition at the anode interface was monitored by ex situ XRD analysis in different cyclic states. In Figure 4 e, the formation of a Zn$_{4}$SO$_{4}$(OH)$_{6}$ · x H$_{2}$O (ZSH) layer on the surface of Zn was observed after 5 cycles in ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes, and the characteristic diffraction peaks of ZSH gradually intensified during subsequent cycles. Conversely, no significant signal corresponding to ZSH was detected in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte during a cycle from 5 to 50 ( Figure 4 f). The findings presented above further support the effectiveness of the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte in suppressing side reactions and facilitating the formation of a stable SEI during electrochemical processes. To investigate this phenomenon, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted, revealing the presence of two semicircles in the high-frequency region of EIS curves after 10 cycles in the Gln/ ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte ( Figure S11 ). This suggests the existence of an additional charge transfer interface resulting from the formation of a SEI. 23 , 28 , 29 As the cycling time increased, the R$_{ct}$ gradually decreased from 60 Ω to 15 Ω and the R$_{SEI}$ remained stable at around 4.7 Ω ( Table S1 ), indicating that the SEI layer can form rapidly in the early cycles and become homogenized during subsequent electrochemical processes. 23 , 28 , 29 Inversely, the impedance dropped to approximately 0 Ω after 50 cycles in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, indicating a significant issue of severe soft short-circuit or even a short-circuit problem in the cells ( Figure S12 ). In conclusion, the aforementioned evidence and analysis demonstrate that the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exerts a significant inhibitory effect on byproduct formation at the Zn surface, thereby effectively preventing uncontrolled dendrite growth and facilitating uniform deposition of Zn. Consequently, this leads to the development of a stable SEI film.

To further validate the impact of Gln on SEI formation, XPS depth profiles of Zn anodes were acquired after 20 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm - 2 and a capacity of 1 mA h cm - 2 in a Zn//Zn symmetric cell. The C 1s spectrum ( Figure 4 g) reveals that there is no significant presence of a C  O signal in the pristine state of the zinc anode, as observed when compared to the signal from pristine Gln. However, a

noticeable increase in the C  O signal is observed, indicating the conversion of a fraction of the C  O group into a C  O bond upon interaction with the Zn surface. Increasing etching depth does not result in any discernible change in the C1 signal, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of Gln-related species within SEI. Furthermore, the N 1s spectra of CONH$_{2}$ ( Figure 4 h) in the pristine Zn anode show a decrease compared with that of pristine Gln. This may be attributed to the formation of N  Zn bonds between CONH$_{2}$ and the Zn surface through amide functional groups containing nitrogen. These facts further prove that Gln tightly adsorbs onto the Zn foil surface via strong coordination and electrostatic interaction between the zinc metal surface and amide groups. According to previous studies, ZnS has been demonstrated as an effective SEI component in facilitating the uniform deposition of zinc. 2 , 3 , 11 As depicted in Figure 4 i, the S 2p spectrum of the original state in Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes reveals discernible signals corresponding to ZnS and ZnSO$_{3}$, potentially attributed to the reduction process of SO$_{4}$ 2 - ions. 3 Moreover, the dominance of the ZnS signal gradually increases with increasing etching depth. In contrast, a distinct  SO$_{4}$  signal was observed in the S 2p spectrum ( Figure 4 j) of the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte, indicating the presence of ZnSO$_{4}$ salt precipitation and interfacial parasitic byproduct ZSH. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the intensity of  SO$_{4}$  remained constant even with increasing etching depth, suggesting continuous occurrence of side reactions throughout the cycle. This phenomenon can also be observed in the O 1s spectrum ( Figure S13 ). Prior to sputtering, the pristine surface of Zn anodes recovered from the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits a slight  SO$_{x}$  signal and a distinct undesired Zn(OH)$_{2}$ signal in Figure S13a . After further Ar + sputtering depth profiles, along with Zn(OH)$_{2}$ and  SO$_{x}$  , the characterization peak of ZnO is also detected. These compositions can also be attributed to the precipitation of ZnSO$_{4}$ salt in the electrolyte and interfacial parasitic reactions triggered by the HER, passivation, and other corrosion reaction byproducts. On the other hand, the O 1s spectrum in Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte ( Figure S13b ) predominantly consists of signals originating from Gln-related species and  SO$_{x}$  (ZnSO$_{3}$), exhibiting minimal variations regardless of the etching depth. In conjunction with the aforementioned analysis results, it has been demonstrated that an organic/inorganic hybrid SEI comprising Gln and ZnS can be formed in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte. Therefore, this organic/inorganic hybrid SEI effectively suppresses side reactions, resulting in the homogeneity of the electrode surface.

Mechanical Properties of the SEI. Furthermore, the mechanical property of the SEI is greatly influenced by the different components present on the Zn surface. 30 While there have been investigations on Zn plating and stripping, studies focusing on the mechanical property of the SEI are scarce. However, understanding its mechanical behavior is crucial as it determines how this SEI responds to stress induced by volume changes, breakage, or deformation. 17 , 31 Therefore, we employed nanoindentation testing on the zinc anode interface after 20 cycles at 1 mA cm - 2 and 1 mA h cm - 2 in a Zn//Zn symmetric cell with different electrolytes and a pristine zinc plate to simulate the stress induced by volumetric changes of SEI during the cycle and elucidate the mechanical response of SEI in terms of its modulus and hardness ( Figure 4 m). The elastic modulus serves as an indicator of the extent of deformation, with a higher modulus indicating reduced

material deformability and increased susceptibility to brittle fracture. 30 Conversely, a lower modulus promotes material flexibility and enhances deformability. 30 As can be seen in Figure S14a and Figure 4 k, the modulus - displacement curves and the average modulus of the SEI in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte are significantly higher than those in Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$. This observation suggests that the SEI formed in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits limited resistance to deformation and fails to maintain intimate contact with the zinc anode during plating/stripping cycles, rendering it susceptible to rupture. In contrast, the SEI formed in Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ demonstrates flexibility, enabling it to accommodate volume changes and consistently establish co-type contact with the zinc anode for continuous and stable protection. In addition, hardness is also an indicator to prove the mechanical properties of materials. 30 As depicted in Figure S14b and Figure 4 l, the hardness of the SEI in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits a significantly higher value compared to that formed in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte. Furthermore, the SEI generated in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte displays a rough and uneven morphology ( Figure 4 c), making it susceptible to puncturing the separator and resulting in battery short circuits. Conversely, an SEI formed in the Gln/ ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte with a lower hardness demonstrates improved compatibility with the separator without causing any mechanical damage. As can be seen from the load -

displacement curves ( Figure 4 n - p) of different SEI and pristine Zn, the SEI in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits 96% irreversible deformation, while pristine Zn shows 91% irreversible deformation. In contrast, the SEI in the Gln/ ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte only demonstrates 25% irreversible deformation upon unloading, indicating its inherent capability for shape recovery under external stimuli. Based on the aforementioned analysis, we have demonstrated that Gln/ ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte promotes the formation of a topologically adaptable SEI with a low modulus, low hardness, and shape recovery capability. This SEI effectively accommodates the volume changes of the zinc anode during repetitive zinc ion plating/stripping cycles while maintaining continuous contact with the anode surface, thereby ensuring long-term stable protection for the zinc anode.

Stripping/Plating Performance of the Zn Anode. To demonstrate the effectiveness of inhibiting side reactions and forming a topologically adaptable SEI with Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes, the electrochemical stability of Zn//Cu asymmetric and Zn//Zn symmetric batteries was investigated through electroplating/stripping processes. The Zn//Cu asymmetric cell in the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits a gradual degradation of voltage hysteresis after 65 cycles ( Figure 5 a). However, the utilization of the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte in the Zn//Cu asymmetric cell ( Figure 5 b) demonstrates better

stability with a consistent voltage hysteresis of approximately 36 mV, maintaining this stability for up to 1000 cycles. Moreover, the employment of the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte in the asymmetric cell consistently showcases stable voltage performance, achieving an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.65% over a prolonged cycling period of 1000 cycles ( Figure 5 c). In stark contrast, the utilization of the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte leads to premature failure after only 65 cycles due to fluctuating voltage. When the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte was used, a significant enhancement of CE was observed due to Gln regulation of the EDL structure to inhibit side reactions and the formation of a topologically adaptable SEI to ensure long-term stable protection of the zinc anode. Furthermore, the Zn//Zn cells employing Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte demonstrate exceptional long-term cycling stability exceeding 4000 h at a current density of 1 mA cm - 2 and capacity of 1 mA h cm - $^{2}$, as depicted in Figure 5 d and Figure S15 . As can be seen, the cyclic performance of the symmetric battery was improved to varying degrees in the presence of Gln. However, when the amount of Gln added is less than 300 mM, it is insufficient to effectively promote stable SEI generation and achieve a sustained and effective protective effect. When the addition amount reaches 300 mM, the performance observed is approximately 40 times higher than that observed in symmetric cells utilizing ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte. And the superior performance of Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes in harsh environments was demonstrated, leading to further enhancements in both current density and plating capacity. Figure 5 e,f and Figure S16 depict the stable cycle life of Zn//Zn symmetric cells with Gln/ ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte at 5, 10, and 20 mA cm - $^{2}$, which are recorded as 1600, 1200, and 300 h, respectively. These exceptional properties still significantly surpass those observed in symmetrical batteries using ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes. Importantly,

the Zn//Zn pouch symmetric cells (3 × 5 cm - 2 Zn foils) employing Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibited cycling stability over 1200 h and cumulative capacity exceeding 18,000 mA h at both current densities of 1 mA cm - 2 and 1 mA h cm - 2 ( Figure 5 g), surpassing those with ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte. The above analysis evaluates the potential practical applicability of the current system in challenging environments. To further emphasize the efficacy of Gln additives, we also conducted a performance comparison of Zn//Zn symmetric cells with other reported strategies. 2 , 11 , 18 , 21 , 32 - 39 As shown in Figure 5 h, the utilization of Gln additives for in situ formation of a topologically adaptable SEI confers ultralong cycle life on Zn anodes across a wide range of current densities when compared to previous studies, thereby elucidating the favorable impact exerted by Gln additives.

Electrochemical Performance of Full Cells. To evaluate the potential application of this electrolyte control strategy, complete cells were fabricated by employing NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ as the cathode and pristine Zn foil as the anode. The initial CV curves of the Zn//NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ full cells in different electrolytes exhibited a similar shape ( Figure S17 ), indicating that Gln was unreactive during the electrochemical process. The durability of the full cells was evaluated by conducting self-discharge performance tests in different electrolytes, as shown in Figure 6 a,b. Impressively, after a 48 h rest period, the full cell utilizing Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte demonstrated a capacity retention of 96%, surpassing that of the ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte (81% capacity retention). To further enhance zinc utilization and minimize unnecessary zinc loss, we used a thin Zn anode (20 μ m) to investigate Zn//NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ full cells with a low negative/ positive capacity ratio (N/P) ( Figure 6 c - f and Figures S18 and S19 ). The cycling performance of the full cells with a N/P ratio of 4.9 is shown in Figure 6 c. The cell in the ZnSO$_{4}$

electrolyte survives for 1640 cycles at 5 A g - 1 before failure, while the cell in the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte exhibits stable cycling over 4500 cycles with a high capacity retention of up to 87% (after 100 cycles of activation). Upon further reduction of the N/P to 3.5 ( Figure 6 d), the full cell using Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte at 5 A g - 1 also holds a capacity retention of 100% after 900 cycles (after 100 cycles of activation). Furthermore, when the N/P ratio drops to 2.4 ( Figure 6 e), the full cell using the Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte at 0.5 A g - 1 also holds a capacity retention of 83% after 300 cycles (after 20 cycles of activation). To create a more practical scenario, a single layer Zn/ NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ pouch cell with an N/P ratio of 5.2 was assembled. It can withstand 400 cycles without a short circuit ( Figure 6 f). The impressive cycling performance can be attributed to the significantly reduced side reactions and topologically adaptable SEI induced by Gln. Therefore, it can be concluded that Gln plays a crucial role in the regulation of the EDL structure and the formation of a topologically adaptable SEI to inhibit side reactions, thereby leading to enhanced electrochemical performance of full cells even under practical conditions.

## CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the incorporation of L-glutamine (Gln) regulates the structure of EDL and promotes the formation of a topologically adaptable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with low modulus and hardness, highlighting the significant impact of mechanical properties on zinc surface SEI performance in batteries. The topologically adaptable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) effectively suppresses side reactions and accommodates volume changes in the zinc anode during zinc ion plating/ stripping, enabling Zn//Zn symmetric cells to demonstrate an exceptionally long cycle life of 4000/1600/1200/300 h at a current density of 1/5/10/20 mA cm - 2 using a coin cell. Additionally, it achieves a high cumulative capacity of 18,000 mA h with a pouch cell. More importantly, the Gln additives have also been demonstrated in Zn//NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ full cells at low N/P ratios of 5.2, 4.9, 3.5, and 2.4, which further proves the effectiveness of Gln additive for Zn anode protection. The construction strategy of regulating the surface absorption environment of EDL to form a topologically adaptable SEI proved the performance of the SEI depends not on its rigidity and hardness but rather on its ability to withstand permanent deformation, providing a promising direction for future interfacial modulation in aqueous battery chemistry.

## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Preparation of Electrolytes. A baseline electrolyte of 2 mol L - 1 ZnSO$_{4}$ was prepared by dissolving pure zinc sulfate (ZnSO$_{4}$ · 7H$_{2}$O, Aladdin) in deionized water. L-Glutamine (C$_{5}$H$_{10}$N$_{2}$O$_{3}$, Aladdin) was added to the prepared 2 mol L - 1 ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolyte at varying concentrations (100 - 500 mM) to obtain Gln/ZnSO$_{4}$ electrolytes.

Preparation of Electrodes. The purchased zinc foil (99.99%, 100 or 20 μ m) was washed with ethyl alcohol to remove the surface stain. Subsequently, the zinc foil was cut into a disc shape ( φ = 12 mm) for use as a zinc electrode. The purchased Cu foil (30 μ m) was washed with acetone to remove the surface stain and then cut into a disc ( φ = 12 mm). The NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ power was synthesized using the hydrothermal method described in the literature. 40 The NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ cathodes were obtained by combining NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ powder, super P, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder in a mass ratio of 7:2:1. N -Methyl-2-pyrrolidone was used as the solvent for mixing. The resulting slurry was then applied onto stainless steel meshes and subjected to vacuum drying at 90 ° C for 12 h.

Characterizations. The Thermo Scientific iN10 was utilized for Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of electrolytes. The HORIBA HR Evolution powered by a 532 nm argon-ion laser was employed to obtain the Raman spectrum of electrolytes. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted by using the Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument equipped with an Al Ka X-ray source. The morphologies of the samples were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) by Hitachi UHR SU8220. For X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis, a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu Ka radiation was used. To assess the mechanical properties of SEI, nanoindentation tests were performed utilizing a U9820A Nano Indenter G200 instrument.

Electrochemical Measurements. All testing CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an open-air environment by using a glass fiber filter (GF/D, Whatman) as the separator. The electrolyte amount used in coin cells was 100 μ L. Zn//Zn symmetric cells were fabricated by using two identical Zn foils (100 μ m). Zn//Cu asymmetric cells were assembled with Cu foil (30 μ m) as the working electrode and Zn foil (100 μ m) as the reference and counter electrode. Zn//NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ full cells were assembled using Zn foil (20 μ m) as the anode and NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ as the cathode. To assemble Zn//NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ pouch cells, NH$_{4}$V$_{4}$O$_{10}$ cathodes (area = 4.5 × 2.5 cm$^{2}$) were coupled with the Zn foil (area = 5 × 3 cm$^{2}$, thickness = 20 μ m) and a glass fiber filter was used as the separator (area = 6 × 4 cm$^{2}$). The discharge/charge measurements of cells were conducted using a LAND Cell Test System. CV curves of the Zn plating/stripping were measured using the Zn//Cu coin cell at a scan rate of 1 mV s - $^{1}$. EIS were recorded with a frequency ranging from 0.1 to 10 6 Hz. The chronoamperometry tests were measured based on the Zn//Zn coin cell at a fixed overpotential of - 150 mV. LSV curves were measured using a Zn//Ti coin cell at a scan rate of 10 mV s - $^{1}$. Tafel plots were measured based on the Zn//Zn coin cell by scanning between - 0.3 and 0.3 V at 5 mV s - $^{1}$. The differential capacitance - potential curves were carried out through Mott - Schottky tests in Zn//Cu cells at a frequency of 6 Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV with potential ranging from 0.9 to 0.3 V (vs Zn/Zn$^{2+}$). Electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) measurements for CV curves of Zn//Zn symmetric cells were taken at a scan rate of 6 - 16 mV s - 1 between - 15 and 15 mV and calculated through the equation C = i / v ( C , capacitance; i , current; the value of i was determined by taking half of the current difference between positive and negative scan under each scanning rate).
