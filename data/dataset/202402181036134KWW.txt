## ABSTRACT

Herein, a novel dual-mode probe for organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) colorimetric and photothermal detection was developed based on manganese modified porphyrin metal -organic framework (PCN-224-Mn). PCN-224Mn had excellent oxidase-like activity and oxidized colorless 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to blue -green oxidation state TMB (oxTMB), which exhibited high temperature under near-infrared irradiation. L-ascorbate-2phosphate was hydrolyzed by acid phosphatase to produce ascorbic acid, which weakened colorimetric and photothermal signals by impacting oxTMB generation. The presence of OPs blocked the production of ascorbic acid by irreversibly inhibiting the activity of acid phosphatase, causing the restoration of chromogenic reaction and the increase of temperature. Under the optimal conditions, the probe showed a good linear response to OPs in the concentration range of 5 ~ 10000 ng/mL, using glyphosate as the analog. The detection limits of glyphosate in colorimetric mode and photothermal mode were 1.47 ng/mL and 2.00 ng/mL, respectively. The probe was successfully used for sensitive identification of OPs residues in tea, brown rice, and wheat flour. This work proposes a simple and reliable colorimetric/photothermal platform for OPs identification, which overcomes the problem that single-mode detection probes are susceptible to external factors, and has broad application potential in the field of food safety.

## 1. Introduction

Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are the backbone of the pesticide industry. It has been widely used in agricultural production over the past decades due to its advantages of effectively controlling pests to improve crop yield [1]. Unfortunately, the OPs ' residue is becoming more serious with increasing usage. It can contaminate water resources, fruits, vegetables, and processed foods, and cause diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders through long-term exposure. This have brought great harm to the ecological environment and human health [2]. Nowadays, a variety of methods for OPs detection have been developed, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [3], gas chromatography (GC) [4], mass spectrometry (MS) [5], and enzymelinked immunoassay (ELISA) [6]. Although these methods display high sensitivity and accuracy, they also have certain limitations [7]. For example, HPLC, GC, and MS require professional and technical personnel to operate and expensive equipment [8]. The ELISA method has some problems, such as expensive antibodies and laborious labeling of aptamers on nanomaterials [9]. Hence, it is necessary to construct a simple, efficient, and low-cost detection method for OPs.

Colorimetric analysis is considered to be a promising technique for OPs detection due to the advantages of low cost, ease of operation, and visual reading [10,11]. This analysis usually uses natural enzymes to oxidize the chromogenic substrate to produce a colored signal, and the competition between the products of the enzymatic reaction and the substrate can limit the production of this signal [12]. Due to the inhibitory effect of OPs on enzyme activity, the detection of OPs residue can be realized by observing the degree of color rendering in the reaction. However, the sensitivity of methods to analyze the target ' s concentration based on the enhancement or attenuation of the color is usually limited and is susceptible to interference from environmental factors (e. g., light intensity), resulting in inaccurate readings [13]. Combining colorimetric signals with other sensing modes to build a multisignal integration platform can provide a more attractive way to effectively improve sensing performance. At present, combining colorimetry with fluorescence [14], electrochemistry [15], or photothermal mode [16] has improved the detection sensitivity. Among these detection modes, the photothermal signal is considered to be a powerful complement to colorimetry [17]. This detection mode has a lower background because the temperature change is mainly caused by the photothermal effect [18]. In addition, detection methods that rely on photothermal signals are not limited by time, place, and professional operators. Inspired by this, the development of an integrated platform for colorimetric and

photothermal reading is expected to achieve visual, portable, and highly sensitive multimode detection of OPs.

Enlightened by the aforementioned work, this study prepared a novel MOF-based nanozyme (PCN-224-Mn) with excellent oxidase-like catalytic activity by coordinating Mn (II) to the porphyrin cavity of PCN-224 composed of zirconium (Zr) clusters and porphyrin ligands. A dual-mode probe for OPs colorimetric and photothermal detection was developed based on the catalytic activity, the competition effect between enzymatic reaction products and substrates, the inhibition of OPs on enzyme activity, and photothermal effect of oxidation products. As shown in Scheme 1, PCN-224-Mn catalyzes colorless TMB to produce the blue -green oxidation state TMB, which exhibits a high temperature under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation at 808 nm. Under the catalysis of acid phosphatase (ACP), L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AA2P) was hydrolyzed to ascorbic acid (AA), which reduced the generation of oxTMB, thereby weakening the colorimetric and photothermal signals. The presence of OPs irreversibly inhibited the enzymatic activity of ACP, and the hydrolysis of AA2P to AA was blocked. This phenomenon caused the restoration of the TMB chromogenic reaction and a rise in the temperature of the solution. By monitoring the change of colorimetric and photothermal signals, semi-quantitative, visual, and dual-mode detection of OPs residues can be realized. The establishment of the detection platform provides a novel way for the quality and safety control of agricultural products.

In recent years, due to the advantages of low cost, easy preparation, and high stability, numerous nanozymes have been developed to replace natural enzymes [19]. A series of nanozymes is used to construct analytical systems, and metal -organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of metal nodes and organic ligands are typical of them due to adjustable activity and stable structures [20]. At present, MOF such as MIL-53 [21], MIL-68 [22], and UiO-66 [23] have been reported to be used in enzymelike catalysis. Unfortunately, most simple MOFs with monometallic nodes and ligands are difficult to simulate the complex spatial structure and coordination environment of natural enzyme active centers [24]. The introduction of secondary metals into monometallic counterparts is an effective method to regulate the activity of heterogeneous catalysts because it provides a new geometric active site for the catalyst and changes the electronic properties of the active site [25,26]. Therefore, doping metal elements into initial MOFs may be a simple, efficient, and reliable strategy for designing highly catalytically active MOF nanozymes.

## 2.2. Synthesis of PCN-224-Mn

PCN-224-Mn was synthesized according to the previous report [27]. Typically, 90 mg of ZrOCl$_{2}$, 30 mg of TCPP, and 0.84 g of BA were added to 30 mL of DMF. The mixed solution was treated with a 90 · C in water bath for 5 h, and subsequently centrifugated at 12000 rpm for 20 min. The resulting purple precipitate was washed twice with DMF and

ultrapure water, respectively. PCN-224 powder was obtained by vacuum drying overnight at 40 · C. Subsequently, 100 mg MnCl$_{2}$ · 4H$_{2}$O and 50 mg PCN-224 were dissolved in 20 mL of DMF. The mixture was stirred in an oil bath at 120 · C for 12 h, and then centrifuged and dried under vacuum to obtain PCN-224-Mn.

## 2.3. Characterization of PCN-224-Mn

The morphology was observed using HT-7700 Hitachi highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Japan). ζ -potentials and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed on a Malvern ZSU3100 Zetasizer Nano analyzer (UK). X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X ' Pert ' 3 Powder, Holland) was used to analyze the crystalline structure. The analysis of elemental compositions and surface functional groups was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet 6700, USA). The ultraviolet -visible (UV -vis) absorption spectra were collected by an UV2600i spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Mn content was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP -OES, Thermo Fisher iCAP PRO, Germany).

## 2.4. Determination of oxidase-like activity

Typically, 60 μ L of PCN-224-Mn solution (0.3 mg/mL) was added into 600 μ L of NaAc-HAc buffer solution (0.2 M, pH 4) containing 0.2 mM TMB. After incubation at room temperature for 6 min, the absorption spectra of the mixed solution were recorded immediately on the UV2600i spectrophotometer. The effect of each parameter on the oxidaselike activity was explored by varying the concentrations of PCN-224-Mn solution and TMB solution, pH, and temperature, respectively.

## 2.5. Kinetic analysis

The kinetic analysis was carried out with different concentrations of TMB solution (0.05 ~ 0.25 mM in NaAc-HAc buffer solution, pH = 4). Afterwards, 60 μ L of PCN-224-Mn solution (0.3 mg/mL) was added to the above solution, and the absorbance at 652 nm of the solution was recorded. According to the Michaelis -Menten equation, the maximum reaction rate (V$_{max}$) and Michaelis -Menten constant (K$_{m}$) were obtained as follows:

where V and V$_{max }$represent the initial reaction rate and the maximum initial reaction rate, respectively. [S] stands for the substrate concentration, and K$_{m }$is the Michaelis constant.

## 2.6. Colorimetric and photothermal detection of OPs

A dual-mode probe for OPs detection was developed exploiting the catalytic activity of PCN-224-Mn and TMB as color and photothermal indicators. Glyphosate (Gly) was used as a model analyte to explore the response of the probe to OPs. In brief, a series of concentration gradient Gly solutions (30 μ L) were incubated at 37 · C with the mixture of ACP solution (60 μ L, 0.06 mg/mL) and NaAc-HAc buffer (690 μ L, 0.2 M, pH 4), respectively. After 30 min, 10 μ L of AA2P solution (2 mM) was introduced to the above solution, and the resulting solution continued to incubate for 30 min. Subsequently, 60 μ L of PCN-224-Mn solution (0.3 mg/mL) and 600 μ L of TMB solution (0.2 mM) were added to the mixture. After incubation at room temperature for 6 min, the UV -vis absorption spectra of the solution were recorded.

As for photothermal analysis, the resulting solution was added to a 48-well plate and irradiated for 16 min utilizing an MDL-III-808 -2 W NIR laser (2 W/cm$^{2}$) for 16 min. During this period, the solution

temperature was recorded using a portable infrared thermal camera (FeilC Intelligent Technology Co., LtD., Shanghai, China) assisted by a smartphone.

## 2.7. Feasibility test

The practical application potential of the constructed probe in Gly detection was explored by a standard addition assay using tea, brown rice, and wheat flour (purchased from a local supermarket) as actual samples. Briefly, 30 μ L of Gly solution (0.5 ~ 2 μ g/mL) was added to 0.5 g of tea sample, and the mixture was placed in the fume hood at room temperature for 1 h to vaporize methanol. The resulting tea samples were placed in the refrigerator overnight to ensure that the Gly was fully absorbed. Subsequently, Gly was extracted according to GB/T 18625 -2002. The tea was soaked in 5 mL acetone solution and fully oscillated for 5 min. Whereafter, 0.5 mL of acetone extract was volatilized and further dissolved in 0.3 mL of NaAc-HAc buffer solution. To remove phenols from the tea, 0.1 mL of hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (30 %) was added and shaken well. After 10 min, 0.3 mL sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution (0.1 mg/mL) was introduced. The obtained Gly extract was analyzed according to the method in Section 2.6. Brown rice and wheat flour were treated in the same method as tea.

## 3. Results and discussions

## 3.1. Characterization of the prepared PCN-224-Mn

PCN-224-Mn was prepared by coordinating Mn 2 + to the porphyrin cavity of the MOF composed of Zr$_{6 }$ nodes and TCPP ligands. The micromorphology was characterized by HR-TEM images. As shown in Fig. 1A, PCN-224 appeared as a monodisperse uniform spherical structure with an average particle size of 76.9 ± 10.5 nm (n = 163). After the introduction of Mn 2 + , PCN-224-Mn showed the aggregated spherical structure with small particles on its surface, and the average particle size was increased to 99.4 ± 11.3 nm (n = 70) (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C displays that the zeta potential of PCN-224 is 25.2 ± 0.7 mV and the potential decreases to GLYPH<0> 3.9 ± 0.4 mV after doping Mn 2 + . This result verified the successful doping of Mn 2 + and PCN-224. The DLS data in Fig. 1D showed that their hydrodynamic diameters were 164.7 nm and 189.2 nm, respectively. The increase in particle size might be caused by the enhanced hydration ability of PCN-224 after Mn 2 + doping [28]. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1E presented that PCN-224 exhibited five characteristic peaks at 5.2 · , 5.6 · , 6.1 · , 6.3 · , and 7.1 · , corresponding to (022), (222), (004), (224), and (006) crystal faces, respectively. This was consistent with the standard card of PCN-224 [29]. The crystallinity of PCN-224 was significantly reduced after Mn 2 + doping, which might be due to the Mn 2 + doping in porphyrin ring led to increase the disorder in the MOF crystal.

XPS spectra were further determined to analyze the elemental composition and chemical structure of PCN-224-Mn. As shown in Fig. 1F, PCN-224-Mn mainly consisted of C, O, Mn, N, and Zr, with corresponding contents of 39.93 %, 38.62 %, 16.14 %, 3.38 %, and 1.93 %, respectively. However, ICP-OES result showed that the content of Mn was 25.81 wt%, which was significantly higher than that of XPS. This was because XPS was used for surface element testing and ICP-OES was used for overall element testing. This caused the presence of Mn element in some porphyrin cavities to be difficult to detect by XPS [30]. The high content of Mn element supported the successful coordination of Mn in PCN-224. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Mn 2p in Fig. 1G exhibited characteristic peaks belonging to Mn 2p$_{1/2 }$ and Mn 2p$_{3/2 }$ at 653.3 eV and 642.3 eV. The peaks of Mn 2p$_{3/2 }$were further divided into two peaks at 642.3 eV and 640.7 eV, representing the presence of Mn in different valance (Mn 2 + and Mn 3 + ) [31]. In addition, Fig. S1 exhibits two characteristic peaks of Zr 3d at 182.4 eV (Zr 3d$_{5/2}$) and 184.9 eV (Zr 3d$_{3/2}$), which indicates the presence of Zr 4 + [32,33]. The absence of characteristic peaks at 180.8 eV and 181.8 eV suggested that PCN-224-

Mn contained no Zr 2 + and Zr 3 + [34]. These data demonstrated that Zr mainly existed in PCN-224-Mn in the form of Zr 4 + . FTIR spectra were determined to reflect the surface functional groups. As shown in Fig. 1H, the surface of PCN-224-Mn contained C -OH (1256 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), C -O (1708 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), N -H (965 cm GLYPH<0> 1 and 3310 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), and N -Mn (1010 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) groups. In contrast, the strength of C -OH and C -O stretching vibration bands of PCN-224 and PCN-224-Mn was lower than that of TCPP, which may be caused by the coordination between the Zr$_{6 }$ cluster and the carboxyl group in TCPP. In addition, the absence of the N -H bond and the formation of the N -Mn bond in PCN-224-Mn in Fig. 1I verified the successful coordination of the porphyrin cavity with Mn 2 + .

The thermal stability result is shown in Fig. 1J. The weight loss in the range of 100 · C~380 · C was due to the dehydration of Zr$_{6 }$nodes. The apparent weightlessness of the second stage in the temperature range from 380 · C~550 · C was attributed to the decomposition of porphyrin in the MOF [35]. When the temperature exceeded 550 · C, the weight of PCN-224-Mn tended to stabilize, possibly owing to that Mn 2 + was connected to the porphyrin center through coordination to form a stable structure. The DTG curves in Fig. 1K illustrate that PCN-224-Mn did not exhibit an obvious thermal degradation peak when the temperature exceeded 550 · C, which confirmed that the structure of PCN-224 modified with Mn 2 + was stable.

The optical property was further analyzed. As illustrated in Fig. 1L, PCN-224 exhibited the UV -vis absorption peaks at 432 nm and in the range of 500 ~ 700 nm belonging to the score and Q bands of TCPP, respectively [35]. In contrast, the score band of PCN-224-Mn was significantly redshifted, and the Q-band intensity was weakened, indicating the coordination of Mn 2 + with the porphyrin cavity. The above data fully confirmed the successful preparation of PCN-224-Mn.

## 3.2. Evaluation of oxidase-like activity

As shown in Fig. 2A, neither the TMB solution nor the PCN-224-Mn solution exhibited characteristic absorption peaks in the range of 500 ~ 700 nm. However, when PCN-224-Mn coexisted with TMB, an obvious absorption peak appeared at 652 nm, which was because oxTMB was produced by the catalytic oxidation of PCN-224-Mn to TMB. In addition to TMB, PCN-224-Mn can also catalyze other substrates including OPD and ABTS. As shown in Fig. 2B, in the presence of PCN-224-Mn, the OPD solution and the ABTS solution exhibited obvious absorption peaks at 450 nm and 400 nm. The solutions appeared yellow and blue in daylight, respectively. The above data provided strong support for the simulated oxidase catalytic activity of PCN-224-Mn.

To obtain optimal catalytic activity, key parameters such as

(H) Absorption spectra of PCN-224-Mn solutions at different pH.

concentration of PCN-224-Mn, reaction time, pH, and temperature were further optimized. As shown in Fig. 2C, the absorbance at 652 nm gradually increased with increasing PCN-224-Mn concentration. When the concentration of PCN-224-Mn exceeded 0.3 mg/mL, the absorbance tended to be stable, indicating that all TMB was oxidized. Therefore, 0.3 mg/mL of PCN-224-Mn was selected as the catalyst for TMB in the subsequent experiments. The effect of the reaction time on the catalytic effect is shown in Fig. 2D. The characteristic peak intensity of oxTMB at 652 nm was positively correlated with the reaction time. After 6 min, the absorbance reached the maximum and no longer increased, indicating that the TMB reaction catalyzed by PCN-224-Mn reached dynamic equilibrium. Consequently, the reaction time was set to 6 min.

As with numerous simulated enzymes, pH and temperature were also important factors affecting the catalytic efficiency. In Fig. 2E, PCN-224Mn presented strong catalytic activity at pH = 3 ~ 5, indicating that the acidic environment was conducive to the catalytic reaction. The effect of incubation temperature on catalytic efficiency was presented in Fig. 2F. There was no distinct difference in the catalytic effect at incubation temperatures ranging from 4 · C~60 · C, reflecting that the reaction could be carried out over a wide temperature range. For ease of

operation, 25 · C was chosen as the optimal incubation temperature.

Interestingly, oxTMB exhibited strong absorption at 808 nm, reflecting its photothermal conversion potential (Fig. S2). As displayed in Fig. 2I, under the irradiation of 808 nm of NIR light (2 W/cm$^{2}$), the TMB solution and ultrapure water showed only a slight temperature change within 26 min. However, the temperature of the reaction product of PCN-224-Mn with TMB continued to rise and became stable after 16 min, which verified the photothermal property of oxTMB. Thus, the optimal NIR irradiation time was 16 min. Fig. S3 shows the effect of laser power on the photothermal effect of oxTMB. It can be seen that the temperature of the solution continued to increase with increasing NIR

Moreover, the simulated oxidase activity was evaluated by steadystate kinetic assay. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic curve was acquired by measuring the initial velocities at different concentrations of TMB (Fig. 2G). Further, the double reciprocal plot in Fig. 2G was obtained by taking the double reciprocal of the data in Fig. 2H. The K$_{m }$ and V$_{max }$ calculated using the Michaelis -Menten equation were 0.325 mM and 18.72 × 10$^{-8 }$M/s, respectively. Compared with other nanozymes with oxidase-like activity in Table S1, PCN-224-Mn had a lower K$_{m }$ value, indicating its strong affinity for TMB.

power. A laser power of 2 W/cm$^{2 }$was selected for the analysis of photothermal properties in subsequent experiments.

## 3.3. Construction of the dual-mode detection probe

According to previous reports, ACP can catalyze the hydrolysis of AA2P to produce reducing AA [36], and it can inhibit the catalytic oxidation of PCN-224-Mn to TMB by competitive action. As shown in Fig. 3A, the addition of ACP or AA2P alone did not cause a significant change in the absorption peak of the mixture of PCN-224-Mn and TMB. However, when the reaction product of ACP and AA2P coexisted with TMB, the absorption peak intensity at 652 nm decreased obviously, confirming the competitive effect between the enzymatic reaction product (AA) and TMB. As is well-known, OPs are a potent inhibitors of ACP activity and illustrate a dramatic increase in the absorbance of the mixture after co-incubation of OPs and ACP, indicating that OPs hindered the generation of AA by inhibiting the ACP activity, thereby resuming the catalytic oxidation reaction of PCN-224-Mn with TMB. The influence of ACP concentration on catalytic oxidation was further explored. As shown in Fig. 3B, the absorbance at 652 nm gradually decreased with the increase of ACP concentration, which was due to the fact that more AA was generated and inhibited the catalytic oxidation reaction of PCN-224-Mn with TMB. Therefore, it was potential to construct a colorimetric probe for OPs ' analysis utilizing OPs to mediate ACP activity to regulate catalytic oxidation reaction.

A series of important experimental parameters, namely ACP concentration, AA2P concentration, enzymatic reaction time, pH, and enzymatic reaction temperature, were optimized for optimal detection

This probe was also expected to achieve a photothermal response to OPs given oxTMB ' s excellent photothermal conversion capability. As displayed in Fig. 3C, without the addition of OPs, the temperature of the probe solution increased by 20.6 · C within 16 min under NIR laser irradiation. After the introduction of OPs, the temperature of the probe solution increased by 22.6 · C. This phenomenon happened because ACP activity was inhibited by OPs, resulting in decreased AA production and increased oxTMB yield. Based on this, a dual-modal probe can be designed for the colorimetric and photothermal analysis of OPs by taking advantage of the enzymatic reaction, the competition effect between AA and TMB, the catalytic oxidation reaction, and the photothermal effect of oxTMB.

performance. As shown in Fig. 3D, the absorbance of the probe solution gradually decreased with the increase of ACP concentration. When the ACP concentration reached 0.08 mg/mL, the absorbance reached the lowest and no longer decreased, indicating that all AA2P was hydrolyzed by ACP. To prevent ACP overdose, 0.06 mg/mL ACP was used for the subsequent experiments. The effect of AA2P concentration on the absorbance is illustrated in Fig. 3E. The absorbance of the probe solution decreased with the increase of AA2P concentration in the range of 0 ~ 2 mM. The absorbance remained basically unchanged as the concentration continued to increase, indicating that the enzymatic reaction reached the maximum extent. Therefore, in the following experiments, the concentration of AA2P was set at 2 mM.

In addition, the influence of incubation temperature on the absorbance of the probe solution is shown in Fig. 3I. The absorbance increased distinctly at temperatures below 37 · C or above 45 · C, mainly due to low enzymatic activity or inactivation of ACP resulting in increased oxTMB production. Hence, the incubation temperature was set at 37 · C in the subsequent experiments.

Further, the effect of the enzymatic reaction time was explored. In Fig. 3F, absorbance gradually decreased with the extension of the enzymatic reaction time and remained basically constant after 30 min, which reflected that the enzymatic reaction was basically completed within 30 min. pH is an important factor affecting enzyme activity and the stability of nanomaterials. As shown in Fig. 3G, in the absence of ACP, PCN-224-Mn exhibited a high catalytic effect in the pH 3 ~ 6 range. When ACP was present, the absorbance of the probe solution in this range was significantly reduced, and the change was most obvious at pH = 4. This may be related to the high enzymatic activity of ACP under this condition. Fig. 3H was also able to demonstrate that the pH change did not affect the absorbance of the PCN-224-Mn solution. As a consequence, pH = 4 was chosen for follow-up experiments.

## 3.4. Colorimetric and photothermal detection OPs

The colorimetric and photothermal analytical performance of the constructed probes was evaluated using Gly as a typical OPs under the optimum conditions. As shown in Fig. 4A, with the increase of Gly concentration, the absorbance of the probe solution at 652 nm gradually increased, indicating that Gly regulated the enzymatic reaction by inhibiting the activity of ACP, thus promoting the catalytic oxidation

reaction of TMB. The absorbance of the probe solution was linearly related to the logarithm of Gly concentration in the range of 5 ~ 10000 ng/mL, and the regression equation was y = 0.025lgx + 0.117 (R 2 $_{=}$ 0.991) (Fig. 4B). The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated as 1.47 ng/ mL according to the 3 d/slope rule (d represents the standard deviation

of repeated measurements for 10 blank samples). In addition, the color of the probe solution gradually changed from light green to blue -green with increasing Gly concentration (Fig. 4C), which indicated that the change of absorbance caused the color shift of the probe solution.

The photothermal response of this probe against OPs is shown in Fig. 4D -F. It can be seen that the temperature of the probe solution increased with the increase of Gly concentration. This phenomenon happened because OPs reduced the generation of AA by inhibiting the ACP activity, which led to the increase of oxTMB production. The logarithm of Gly concentration was positively correlated with the temperature change in the range of 5 ~ 10000 ng/mL. The linear regression equation was y = 1.194lgx + 20.643 (R 2 $_{=}$ 0.995), and the LOD was 2.00 ng/mL. The probe proposed in this study had lower LOD and a wider detection range in colorimetric and photothermal detection modes compared with other reported probes (Table S2). More importantly, the detection results obtained by the two modes effectively eliminated common instrumental or human errors and improved the accuracy and reliability of the detection data. Therefore, the constructed colorimetric/photothermal dual-mode channel can be used for sensitive detection of OPs.

## 3.5. Selectivity and anti-interference

In addition to sensitivity, selectivity is also one of the important indicators of analytical performance. The colorimetric and photothermal responses of the probe to various common ions (Na + , K + , Ca 2 + , Mg 2 + , Cu 2 + , Cl GLYPH<0> , SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> , CO$_{3}$ 2 GLYPH<0> , NO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> and HPO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> ), biological macromolecules (BSA and L-His), OPs (Gly, Dichl, and Chlor), and non-OPs (Aceta, Carbe, Proch, and Tebue) were investigated. As shown in Fig. 5A and 5C, only OPs (Gly, Dichl, and Chlor) caused significant changes in absorbance and temperature. However, other interfering substances had negligible changes in colorimetric and photothermal signals even if their concentrations far exceeded the concentrations of OPs, which reflected the

## excellent selectivity of the probe for OPs.

A high concentration of salt ions is also one of the common challenges in the detection process. The salt tolerance of the probe was analyzed by recording the colorimetric and photothermal signal changes in the presence of a series of salt ions. As can be seen from Fig. S4A and B, there was no significant difference between the detection signals of the probe with and without the presence of salt ions from 0 ~ 500 μ g/ mL, reflecting its good salt tolerance and detection stability. The storage stability of the probe is presented in Fig. S5A and B. The colorimetric and photothermal signals of the same batch of probes maintained above 90 % of the original state after 15 days of storage at GLYPH<0> 20 · C, indicating their excellent storage stability.

Further, the detection stability of the probe when these interfering substances coexisted with OPs was investigated. As displayed in Fig. 5B and D, the presence of these interfering substances hardly affected the probe ' s detection stability for OPs, reflecting the excellent antiinterference ability of the probe. This method has the potential to be used for OPs ' residue analysis of complex samples.

## 3.6. Detection of OPs in actual samples

After investigating the analytical performance of OPs by colorimetric and photothermal modes, tea, brown rice, and wheat flour were used as practical samples to verify the practical application potential of the probe in OPs detection. As shown in Table 1, the colorimetric detection recoveries of the probe for Gly residues in tea, brown rice and wheat flour were 99.5 %~105.0 %, 96.0 %~107.0 %, and 99.0 %~105.3 %. The recoveries in the photothermal detection mode were 92.0 %~115.1 %, 94.0 %~109.5 %, and 98.0 %~118.1 %, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 3 %. The results above demonstrated that the probe exhibited good accuracy and stability, and had broad application potential in the analysis of pesticide residues in agricultural products.

## 4. Conclusions

In this study, a PCN-224-Mn-mediated dual-reading platform was proposed for the detection of OPs residues using TMB as a common signal of color and temperature. The coordination of Mn 2 + and the porphyrin cavity of PCN-224 significantly enhanced the oxidase-like activity, which catalyzed the formation of blue -green oxTMB from colorless TMB. This phenomenon exhibited characteristic absorption at 652 nm and a high photothermal effect under NIR light irradiation at 808 nm. Based on the competition between AA2P hydrolysate and TMB and the inhibition of OPs on ACP activity, the sensitive analysis of OPs ' concentration was realized by monitoring the color signal and photothermal signal. This dual-reading probe added a temperature signal read by a portable thermal imager to the traditional color signal. The detection accuracy of the developed probe was verified by spiked recovery experiments in three real samples, which confirmed the practical application potential in food safety monitoring. It is worth mentioning that the integration of colorimetric and photothermal signals can not only promote the accuracy of detection through mutual verification, but also effectively improve detection sensitivity. Therefore, this study also provides a new strategy for the design of simple, sensitive, and reliable multimodal rapid analytical methods for the detection of other safety hazard factors.
