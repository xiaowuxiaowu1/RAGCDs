## ABSTRACT

Porous structured metal -organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives are desired in catalysis and energy storage. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) flower-like NiCoFe LDH/NF are first synthesized though a convenient cathodic electrodeposition strategy subsequent an ion-exchange process. And the morphology and catalytic performance of the CoFe-MOF/NF can be finely by tailoring the electrodeposition voltage, deposition time and the ratio of Co: Fe. The 3D flower-like and porous NiCoFe/NF not only retains structural integrity to promote durability but also greatly alleviates the aggregation of active sites. In addition, the 3D flower-like and porous NiCoFe/NF display remarkable results with low overpotentials of 233 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$for OER and 84 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$for HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. When acting as electrocatalytic electrodes for overall water splitting, NiCoFe/NF displays a low overpotential of 1.52 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. The study provides a promising approach to design MOF electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic applications.

## 1. Introduction

With the advancement of the world economy, traditional fossil fuels are consumed at an unprecedented speed and scale, leaving a negative impact on the environment. The lack of fossil energy and the associated environment problems have stimulated the development and utilization of clean energy. As an importantly renewable energy carrier, hydrogen (H$_{2}$) has the potential to solve the energy crisis and play a very important role in future due to its advantages of high combustion calorific value (4.5 times coke), clean and pollution-free [1 -4]. Therefore, the production of high purity H$_{2 }$has attracted enormous research interest. Nowadays, electrochemical water splitting (EWS) has been regarded as one of the most efficient methods to produce hydrogen gas with high purity [5]. The EWS process consists of two half-cell reactions: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) happening on the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode [6,7]. Nevertheless, the efficiency of

both the HER and OER are limited due to their sluggish kinetics, which requires stable and efficient electrocatalysts to speed up the reaction kinetics and reduce the overpotential [8 -10]. At present, Pt-based materials and noble metal Ru/Ir-based materials are the best candidates for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively [11 -13]. Nevertheless, their high price and scarcity strongly restrict their widespread application [14,15]. Hence, development of high activity and low-cost electrocatalyst especially with bifunction HER and OER activity is highly desirable.

Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a class of porous crystalline materials that are made up of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands, which have been recognized as viable candidates for developing bifunctional electrocatalysts owing to its controllable structure, well ordered porosity channels and highly-active sites [16 -21]. However, the electrocatalytic activities and durability of bulk MOFs are unsatisfactory due to the limited number of active sites, low electrical conductivity and

poor stability [15,22 -24]. Noteworthily, the MOFs can achieve favorable electrical conductivity after heat-treatment activation, but inevitably cause the collapse of porous structure and the aggregation of metal carbides, thus reducing the intrinsic electroactivity and losing the pristine superiority [25 -27]. In order to overcome these obstacles, many studies are devoted to developing inexpensive there-dimensional (3D) electrodes by directly loading MOFs thin film on conductive substrates, especially in-situ growth of MOFs thin film on 3D porous Ni foam (NF), which has received major attention due to its huge specific area of surface and excellent electronic conductivity [28 -31]. Recently, electrochemical deposition (ECD) method is a facile and binder-free for preparing MOFs thin film, which stands out as one of the most promising approaches among a vast variety of techniques [32 -34]. Liu et al. fabricated binder-free Ni-MOF/NF electrodes by utilizing ECD for HER. The self-supporting catalyst exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance toward the HER along with sufficient electrocatalytic actives sites [35].

Inspired by above issues, we propose an electrodeposition-ion exchange strategy to fabricate a 3D flower-like porous NiCoFe LDH on NF (NiCoFe LDH/NF) with abundant active sites. This strategy involves in the construction of the 3D flower-like porous CoFe-MOF/NF via a ECD method and through controlling the deposition voltage, deposition time and the ratio of Co:Fe, the morphology and catalytic performance of CoFe-MOF/NF can be controlled. Subsequently, the porous NiCoFe LDH/NF was successfully prepared through an ion-exchange and etching reaction process with Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2 }$ in ethanol. When used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water spilling, the 3D flower-like porous NiCoFe LDH/NF shows multiscale surface advantages. First, The synergistic effect of the Co and Fe endow the catalyst with fast electron transfer. Second, the 3D flower-like porous architecture can not only offer the electrocatalysts abundant electrochemical active sites and high surface area, but also facilitate the penetration of electrolytes and the release of evolved H$_{2}$/O$_{2 }$ bubbles. Third, the conductive and conventional NF with tight connection to the NiCoFe LDH/NF can be directly used as electrode without any binder additives, which not only prevents the active materials from delaminating, but also ensures good electric conductivity and charge transfer capability. Furthermore, compared to directly synthesized LDHs, MOF-derived LDHs benefit from evenly spaced cationic sheets with avoided aggregation due to the uniform growth process from the well-dispersed MOF metal ions. As a result, the prepared 3D flower-like and porous NiCoFe LDH/NF displays excellent

electrocatalytic performance f with overpotentials of 233 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$for OER and 84 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$for HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. When acting as electrocatalytic electrodes for overall water splitting, NiCoFe/NF displays a low overpotential of 1.52 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$.

## 2. Experimental

## 2.1. Synthesis of 3D flower-like CoFe-MOF/NF thin film

Before electrodeposition, the nickel foam (NF, 1 cm × 1 cm, thickness:1 nm) was cleaned with 1 M HCl, ethanol and deionized water by sonication for 15 min to remove the nickel oxides and oil stains. 78.4 mM of Co(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O and 39.2 mM of Fe(NO$_{3}$)$_{3}$ · 6H$_{2}$O as the cation source, 5.6 mM of 2-NH$_{2}$-BDC as the organic ligand and 0.05 M of NaNO$_{3 }$as the supporting electrolyte were dissolved in the mixed solution of DMF and deionized water (50:50 vol%). Then, the solution was sonicated for 10 min and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, the electrodeposition was carried out in the above prepared solution by applying a suitable potential ( GLYPH<0> 1.5 V) for 230 s at room temperature, in which a standard three-electrode cell was used with a piece of NF, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum slice as working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. The CoFe-MOF/NF was obtained via washing with ultrapure three times and drying at 60 ℃ . To achieve an electrode with excellent electrocatalytic performance without formation of defects or detachment form the substrate surface, the electrodeposition time (80 s, 140 s, 170 s, 200 s, 230 s, 260 s and 320 s), reductive potential ( GLYPH<0> 1.1 V, GLYPH<0> 1.3 V, GLYPH<0> 1.5 V, GLYPH<0> 1.7 V and GLYPH<0> 1.9 V), and the molar ratio of Co:Fe in the bath solution (7:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:7) were all optimized, as illustrated in Fig S1.

## 2.2. Synthesis of 3D flower-like and porous NiCoFe LDH/NF thin film

Though a subsequent ion exchange/etching process using Ni (NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O (0.309 M) in ethanol, the CoFe MOF/NF will be etched and simultaneously NiCoFe layered ternary hydroxide (noted as NiCoFe LDH) will deposit on the surface. The etching concentration and time of Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O have also been optimized to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance in Fig S2.

## 2.3. Synthesis of RuO$_{2 }$ and Pt/C electrode on NF

For comparison, 6 mg of RuO$_{2 }$or Pt/C powders were dispersed to the ethanol (100 µ L) and Nafion (200 µ L) mixture by ultrasonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Afterward, 50 µ L of the ink was dropped on the treated NF surface. The samples were further dried to obtain the RuO$_{2}$/NF and Pt/C/NF.

## 2.4. Electrochemical measurements

Both of the OER and HER electrocatalytic performances were conducted on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) in a typical three-electrode cell in 1 M KOH at room temperature. A carbon rod, a Hg/HgO electrode and the as-prepared samples served as the counter electrode, the reference electrode, and the working electrode (1 × 1 cm), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted with a scan rate of 50 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$to activate the electrode. Then, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were obtained at a scan rate of 1 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$from GLYPH<0> 0.115 to GLYPH<0> 0.785 V vs. RHE for HER, and from 0.915 to 1.915 V vs. RHE for OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. The measured potentials for OER vs SCE were converted to the RHE with the Nernst equation: E$_{RHE }$ = E$_{SCE }$ + 0.242 + 0.0591 × pH, and the measured potentials for HER vs Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with the Nernst equation: ERHE = E$_{SCE }$ + 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH. The double layer capacitance (DLC) was obtained by CV with scanning rates of 1 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 2 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 3 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 4 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$and 5 mV

Controlling the compositions of an electrocatalysts has been also proved to be an effective way to boost its electrochemical activity. The recent studies showed that bimetallic MOFs can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity compared with the single MOFs, because the synergistic effect between different metals can modulate the local electronic density and enrich the active sites [36,37]. Bottcher et al. developed a 2D NiFe-MOF/NF catalyst and their OER and HER performance are much smaller than the Ni-MOF/NF, Fe-MOF/NF, which also exhibited favorable kinetics [38]. Apart from the composition, the morphology of catalysts also has impact on catalytic performance. The porous structure is desirable to enhance catalytic activity because of large surface area and high-density surface-exposed active sites [39,40]. It not only provides rich reaction sites and protects encapsulated active nanoparticles from agglomeration, but also releases the strain during the electrochemical reactions, thus maintaining the integrity of the electrodes [41,42]. For example, a novel hollow NiCo$_{2}$O$_{4 }$ arrays electrode was achieved through an ion-exchange of 2D Co-MOF with Ni 2 + ions and etching process with an additional annealing treatment, which demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances both for electrocatalytic OER and flexible supercapacitor [43]. And 3D flower-like structures present high specific surface areas, more exposed catalytic sites, lower mass transfer resistance and higher electron transport efficiency [44]. Particularly, 3D flower like MOFs structure has been of significant importance, because they have more unsaturated metals sites on the surface [45].

s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100000 Hz for HER. The long-term stability of the catalyst was studied by chronopotentiometry at the overpotential with a constant current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$for 18 h.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Composites fabrication and characterization

The synthesis process of 3D flower-like porous NiCoFe/NF catalytic is illustrated in Scheme 1. A facile ECD method was utilized to fabricate 3D flower-like CoFe bimetal-organic framework thin films on NF (note as CoFe-MOF/NF) in with Co(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O, Fe(NO$_{3}$)$_{3}$ · 6H$_{2}$O, and 2-NH$_{2}$BDC as the starting materials. Then, through a subsequent ion exchange/ etching process using Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O in ethanol, the 3D flower-like CoFe-MOF/NF are etched and simultaneously 3D flower-like and porous NiCoFe LDH/NF is finally deposited on the surface. In this step, the porous strategy for the nanostructure can be described as a hydrolysis controlled ion exchange and etching process (Ni 2 + + 2H$_{2}$O = Ni (OH)$_{2 }$ + 2H + , which the H + will etch the MOF and promote the deposition of NiCoFe LDH), which is efficient to create a central void space.

It is noteworthy to mention that the deposition voltage, deposition time and the ratio of Co:Fe play a critical role in controlling the morphology of CoFe-MOF/NF. As shown in Fig S3A-C and Fig S3D-F, when the deposition voltage is low or the deposition time is short, the morphology of CoFe-MOF exhibit 3D flower-like morphology with larger particle size. However, when the deposition voltage is higher or the deposition time is longer, the size of CoFe MOF/NF gradually decreased. It may be that with the increased of deposition voltage and deposition time, the nucleation rate was also accelerated and more crystals could be generated faster, which caused the crystal size became smaller. And when the Co 2 + concentration is much higher than the Fe 3 +

The morphological and structural characterizations of different samples were characterized by scanning electron microcopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For comparison, the Co-MOF, Fe-MOF and CoFe-MOF thin film are prepared on NF via a ECD method [32]. The SEM images show that the Co-MOF/NF thin film showed a well-defined 3D flower-like morphology with a smooth surface at a large scale and a uniform particle size of about 2 µ m (Fig. 1A). And the FeMOF/NF thin film showed irregular nanoparticles morphology (Fig. 1B). The SEM and TEM images of the CoFe-MOF/NF thin film also present 3D flower-like morphology with a uniform particle size of 0.8 µ m, which has a similar shape of Co-MOF/NF and the particle size is much smaller than Co-MOF/NF. Because of the addition of Fe 3 + promotes the generation rate of Co-MOF (Fig. 1C and E). After etching, the NiCoFe LDH/NF well succeed the 3D flower-like shape of CoFe-MOF/NF with more small nanoflakes on the surface, while the surface becomes fluffy (Fig. 1D). Moreover, from the TEM image in Fig. 1F and G, the 3D flower-like structures become " semitransparent " , indicating that the porous structures have been formed. From the elemental mapping images of NiCoFe LDH/NF, it can be observed that Co, Fe and Ni elements are uniformly distributed in NiCoFe LDH/NF.

concentration (Fig S3G-I), the morphology of CoFe-MOF/NF exhibit 3D flower-like structure, which is similar to the morphology of Co-MOF/NF. When the Fe 3 + concentration is much higher than the Co 2 + concentration, the morphology of Co-MOF/NF exhibit a particle like morphology which similar to Fe-MOF/NF. It is worth mentioning that short-time etching process and low concentration of Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O will result insufficient and retains its original crystallinity, and long-time process and excess dosage of Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O will lead to the overgrowth of 3D flower-like structures (Fig. S4).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to investigate the surface chemical states of NiCoFe LDH/NF. As observed from Fig. 3A, the survey spectra show the presence of Ni, Co, O and Fe elements in the NiCoFe LDH/NF. Two primary peaks at 855.6 eV and 872.8 eV are assigned to Ni 2p$_{3/2 }$and Ni 2p$_{1/2 }$orbits, confirming the presence of Ni in the + 2 and + 3 oxidation state. The other at 860.7 eV and 880.2 eV are the satellite peaks of Ni 2p high-resolution XPS spectrum [48]. Furthermore, as shown in the Fig. 3B, a pair of spin -orbit doubles and two primary peaks at 781.2 eV and 797.1 eV are assigned to Co 2p$_{3/2 }$ and Co 2p$_{1/2 }$ orbits, confirming the presence of Co in the + 2 and + 3 oxidation state, while the 2p$_{3/2 }$ and 2p$_{1/2 }$ core levels of two satellite peaks are allocated at 786.5 eV and 802.9 eV, respectively. These results indicate that the surface of the NiCoFe LDH/NF nanostructures contains Co 2 + and Co 3 + [43]. Notably, the binding energies of Co 2p and Fe 2p for NiCoFe LDH/NF were negatively shifted compared with those of CoFeMOF (Fig. 3B and 3C), indicating the partial reduction of Ni and Fe species. These results prove the synergistic effect between Ni, Co and Fe, which can modify the local charge distribution for high electrocatalytic

The typica X-ray-diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed to investigate the crystal structure of different samples. As show in Fig. 2A, the corresponding XRD patterns are unambiguously assigned to the CoMOF, which corresponding with the reported XRD pattern of Co-MOF [32]. The peaks of CoFe MOF are consistent with Co MOF, indicating that Fe 3 + and Co 2 + are in the same structure, which is consistent with the morphology of CoFe MOF. After Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O etching, the XRD peak of NiCoFe/NF has no change compared to CoFe MOF/NF, indicating that Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O etching is not change the approximate structure of CoFe MOF/NF, which is consistent with the result of SEM images. The Raman spectra of the CoFe-MOF/NF and NiCoFe LDH/NF are show in Fig. 2B. The strong bonds located at around 510 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$is assigned to C -H bending of the benzene ring. The peaks at 1108 cm GLYPH<0> assigned to stretching region of the carboxylate groups. The Raman spectra prove that the CoFe-MOF/NF structure disappeared after etching and NiCoFe LDH/NF produced. In addition, the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 2C) of CoFe-MOF/NF peaks at around 1575 cm GLYPH<0> 1 and 1362 cm GLYPH<0> 1 are assigned to v$_{as}$ ( -COO -) and v$_{s}$ ( -COO -), respectively. The N -H stretching vibration associated with the absorbed water appeared as a broad absorption band centered at 3552 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and the characteristic C -H stretching bands is found at 2921 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$[37]. For NiCoFe LDH/NF, the band located at 1382 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$presumably originated from the intercalated nitrate (NO 3 -) ions (stretching mode)[46]. The broad absorption band centered at 3552 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$corresponds to the O -H stretching vibrations from the coordinated hydroxide ions or intercalated/absorbed water molecules [47].

activities.

## 3.2. Electrocatalytic performance for OER and HER

The catalytic OER activities of each sample were assessed in 1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4A, the LSV curve of 3D flower-like porous NiCoFe LDH presented a low OER overpotential of 233 mV at

a current density of 50 mA · cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, outperforming CoFe-MOF/NF (280 mV), Co-MOF/NF (338 mV), Fe-MOF/NF (367 mV) and RuO$_{2}$/NF (344 mV). Notably, an overpotential of only 242 mV is achieved at a large current density of 100 mA · cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$(Fig. 4B). The NiCoFe LDH/NF catalyst showed a superior performance for OER and even surpassed most of the previously reported LDH or MOF derived based OER electrocatalysts (Tabel S1). The OER kinetics was further evaluated by Tafel plot. As

shown in Fig. 4C, the NiCoFe LDH/NF exhibited the lowest Tafel slope of 29.39 mV · dec$^{-1}$, much lower than CoFe-MOF/NF (35.46 mV · dec$^{-1}$), CoMOF/NF (58.63 mV · dec$^{-1}$), RuO$_{2}$/NF (59.41 mV · dec$^{-1}$) and Fe-MOF/NF (62.60 mV · dec$^{-1}$). The lowest value for NiCoFe LDH/NF indicates its fast catalytic OER kinetics. More importantly, EIS is also tested to further manifest the favorable kinetic properties. The NiCoFe LDH/NF has the

smallest semicircle, indicating that the formation of porous structures improves the conductivity of the catalyst, thus obtaining additional evidence for its kinetic merit for fast electron transfer and ion diffusion during OER catalysis. As mentioned above, the lowest overpotential and fastest kinetics of NiCoFe LDH/NF may be attributed to the exposure of providing more metal sites and regulation of the electronic structure

Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 960 (2024) 118167 Su et al.

after the etching reaction process. In addition to the high activities, the NiCoFe LDH/NF also shows robust stability toward OER. As shown in Fig. 4E, the multi-step chrono-potentiometric curve can instantaneously restore the stable state at different potentials, which also proves its extremely strong stability and fast gas diffusion ability. After 3000 cycles of CV test, the polarization curve of NiCoFe LDH/NF shows no change and the NiCoFe LDH/NF also exhibited excellent long-term stability up to18 h at high current density of 50 mA · cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. Additionally, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was calculated in order to assess the double-layer capacitances (C$_{dl}$). The higher ECSA shows better utilization of the catalytic active sites. As shown in Fig. S5 and Fig. S6, the C$_{dl }$of FeCoNi LDH/NF (4.05 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$) is much larger than those of the Co-MOF/NF (0.42 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), Fe-MOF/NF (0.014 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$) and CoFe-MOF/NF (3.8 GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), indicating that the addition of Ni (NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O is promote the expose of active surface area.

electrocatalytic stability.

## 3.3. Overall water splitting performance

Inspired by the excellent electrocatalytic performance of NiCoFe LDH/NF for both OER and HER, its efficiency toward overall water splitting was further investigated in an alkaline two-electrode system with NiCoFe LDH/NF as cathode and anode. Fig. 6A is a simulated diagram of overall water splitting solution. The LSV curves (Fig. 6B) showed that the NiCoFe LDH/NF ( + ||-) cell only needed a cell voltage of 1.528 V to provide 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, which was quite lower than that of the commercial system of RuO$_{2}$||Pt/C pairs (1.59 V). The observed catalytic performance is well comparable with those of the recently reported catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6C. Additionally, it also performed a favorable long-term durability in terms of the cell voltage sustaining nearly 1.528 V at the current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$for 18 h (Fig. 6D).

## 4. Conclusion

In summary, we have designed and fabricated a novel 3D flower-like porous NiCoFe LDH/NF through a facile two-step strategy by 3D flowerlike bimetallic CoFe-MOF/NF as precursors and temples. Benefitting from the porous structure formed by 3D structure, the MOFs derived NiCoFe LDH/NF could provide a high surface area and expose more active sites to facilitate electrolyte transport and ion diffusion. Intriguingly, NiCoFe LDH/NF exhibits outstanding activity of overpotentials of 233 mV and 84 mV for OER at a current density of 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$and HER at a current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, respectively. For overall water splitting, an only cell voltage of 1.528 V is needed to reach a current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. This study provides an attractive strategy to fabricate highly active and durable electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

The HER activity of the NiCoFe LDH/NF catalyst was also further evaluated in alkaline solution. The NiCoFe LDH/NF catalyst shows the remarkable HER catalytic activity with a low potential of 84 mV at 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, outperforming CoFe-MOF/NF (112 mV), Co-MOF/NF (157 mV), Fe-MOF/NF (163 mV), but slightly higher than Pt/C/NF (56 mV) (Fig. 5A and 5B). However, the NiCoFe LDH/NF shows inferior over potential compared to the catalysts (Table S2). Besides, the corresponding Tafel plots of NiCoFe LDH/NF is 107.3 mV · dec$^{-1 }$(Fig. 5C), which is much lower than those of CoFe-MOF/NF (109.1 mV · dec$^{-1}$), CoMOF/NF (116.2 mV · dec$^{-1}$), and Fe-MOF/NF (125.1 mV · dec$^{-1}$), suggesting the excellent kinetics for HER reaction. According to the EIS calculations (Fig. 5D), the NiCoFe LDH/NF electrocatalyst shows a smallest Rct (12.7 Ω ) in contrast to CoFe-MOF/NF (27.2 Ω ), Co-MOF/NF (30.2 Ω ), and Fe-MOF/NF (69.2 Ω ). The stability of the electrocatalyst is another important parameter for accessing its performance. Multistep CP tests were accomplished to evaluate the stability of the NiCoFe LDH/ NF (Fig. 5E). Even under continuously varying current densities, the catalyst still recognizes such variations and remains stable, showing an excellent stability at different current densities. As shown in Fig. 5F, NiCoFe LDH/NF displayed an excellent electrocatalytic stability, which continued to catalyze the HER over 18 h at the current density of 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. Moreover, the LSV curve of NiCoFe LDH/NF in Fig. 5F shows a negligible shift after 3000 CV cycles demonstrating its excellent
