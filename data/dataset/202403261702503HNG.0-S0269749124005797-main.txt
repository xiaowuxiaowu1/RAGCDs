Persulfate activation-based advanced oxidation processes (PS-AOPs) have been 44 confirmed as effective methods for remediating water contaminated with organic pollutants 45 [1]. Through the activation and cleavage of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate 46 (PDS), the generated reactive species (RSs), such as hydroxyl radical ($^{·}$OH) and sulfate radical 47 (SO 4 $^{·-}$), which possess high redox potential can degrade most organic pollutants via radical 48 addition, hydrogen atom abstraction, and single electron transfer [2]. However, the presence of 49 coexisting ions and natural organic matters (NOMs) in natural water may competitively 50 quench the radicals, resulting in lower-than-expected treatment efficiency [3]. Therefore, 51 nonradical pathway-based PS-AOPs, characterized by insensitivity to environmental factors 52 and high oxidant utilization efficiency, has garnered attention from researchers [4, 5]. 53 Journal Pre-proof

Thus,

the

possesses high selectivity to the electron-rich organic pollutants, and can efficiently remove

pollutants that play important roles in PS-AOPs [10, 11]. The generation of $^{1}$O 2 with nearly

100% selectivity was achieved by PMS activation using carbon nitride supported high

loading Fe single atom and single atom copper embedded MXene as the catalysts [12, 13].

Through suppressing the spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed PMS on the single atom

CoN 2+2

active sites, the exclusive generation of  $^{1}$O 2

via nonradical pathways was achieved

[14].

However, the current challenge is that the targeted activation of PS can almost only be 71 achieved by using single atom catalysts, whereas the PS activation by widespread metal 72 oxides/hydroxides with milder synthesis conditions is unpredictable, and the mixed 73 mechanism of radical and nonradical is more common [15, 16]. The basis for designing high 74 selectivity catalysts is to first elaborate on the mechanism of the $^{1}$O 2 production. Briefly, the 75 bonding of PS molecule to the surface active sites of the catalyst is the first step in the PS 76 activation. Therein, the transfer of electron from the catalyst to PS would cleave the peroxy 77 bond of PS molecules and produce radicals [17]. For the $^{1}$O 2 nonradical pathway, this process 78 may be reversed, where electron transfer from PS to its bonded active site leads to the 79 production of $^{1}$O 2 [13]. It should be noted that HVM and ETP can also be produced from the 80 spontaneous decomposition of PS via electron shuttle, which depends on the redox potential 81 of PS bonded with the active site of the catalyst [18, 19]. 82 Journal Pre-proof

As described in Fig. S1, 2g of CaFe-LDH was immersed in 200 mL of KMnO 4 solution 108

for 12 h. Finally, the black product was collected, washed and dried at 70 ℃ to acquire 112

MF-MnO x . Similarly, MF-MnO x derived from different CaFe-LDH samples were labeled as 113

M 2 F 1 -MnO x , M 3 F 1 -MnO x and M 4 F 1 -MnO x , respectively. The samples derived from 114

CaAl-LDH through the same synthetic method was named MA-MnO x , and the samples 115

obtained by immersing CaFe-LDH without MnO 4 $^{-}$ in MnCl 2 solution was named MF-LDH. 116

3. Results and discussion 119

3.1. Catalysts characterization 120

Journal Pre-proof

The phase composition of MF-MnO x was determined using XRD. As displayed in Fig. 121

S2a, the peaks at 2θ = 31.3° can be indexed to the (104) lattice planes of MnFe-LDH [20, 21]. 122

Significantly, none of the characteristic peaks representing CaFe-LDH (Fig. S2b) were found 123

in MF-MnO x . This suggests that CaFe-LDH was completely transformed into MnFe-LDH 124

with isomorphous substitution of Ca$^{2+}$ by Mn$^{2+}$ in the LDH structure [22]. Moreover, peaks 125

related to the (112), (103) and (211) crystal planes of MnO x were detected at 2θ = 29.2°, 126

32.5° and 36.1° [23, 24]. The formation of MnO x can be deciphered by the simultaneous 127

comproportionation reaction between Mn$^{2+}$ and intercalated MnO 4 $^{-}$ during the isomorphous 128

substitution process. Furthermore, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of MF-MnO x 129

varied with the Ca/Fe molar ratio. Briefly, the intensity of the (104) crystal plane representing 130

MnFe-LDH enhanced with the increase in the Ca ratio, while the peak associated with MnO x 131

gradually decreased. A possible explanation for this can be that CaFe-LDH with a high 132

content of Ca possessed a lower exchange capacity for MnO 4 $^{-}$, leading to the increased 133

formation of MnFe-LDH and the reduced production of MnO x [25, 26]. 134

The surface morphology of MF-MnO x was characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1a, 135

MF-MnO x possessed a typical lamellar structure of brucite, suggesting that mild synthesis 136

condition would not result in the collapse of the LDH structure. On the other hand, this 137

implies that MnO x might intercalate in the interlayer of MnFe-LDH, rather than simply 138

loading on the surface of MnFe-LDH. As seen, the standing-up nanosheets of MF-MnO x with 139

a mean size of 200 nm were found in the HR-TEM image (Fig. 1b). The result further verifies 140

the fact that MnO x intercalated in the interlayer of MnFe-LDH. EDS-mapping of MF-MnO x 141

Journal Pre-proof

demonstrates that the as-prepared catalyst was formed by uniformly distributed Fe, Mn and O 142

elements (Fig. 1c). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1d, the content of Ca in MF-MnO x was less 143

than 1 wt%, which can be ignored. 144

3.2. Catalytic performance assessment 145

The catalytic activity of MF-MnO x was evaluated using BPA as the targeted pollutant. 146

As shown in Fig. 2a, the direct oxidation of BPA by PMS can be ignored, suggesting the 147

reactionlessness of PMS without the presence of catalyst. Additionally, the adsorption of BPA 148 by M 2 F 1 -MnO x was also excluded. The precursor CaFe-LDH possessed limited promotion on 149 the PMS activation, while only 35.6% of BPA was diluted by the CaFe-LDH/PMS system 150 within 20 min reaction time. As for MF-MnO x , it is evident that the catalytic performance 151 varied significantly with different Ca/Fe molar ratio precursors. The removal of BPA by the 152 M 2 F 1 -MnO x /PMS, M 3 F 1 -MnO x /PMS and M 4 F 1 -MnO x /PMS systems were 99.7%, 71.1% and 153 64.0% with the reaction time of 15 min. It is worth noting that, except for the 154 M 2 F 1 -MnO x /PMS system, the fitting degree of the BPA degradation to the first-order kinetic 155 model was low in other systems (Fig. S3). Especially for the samples derived from the 156 precursor with a high content of Ca, two oxidation stages were found in the BPA degradation 157 process. This should be associated with the low content of MnO x in M 3 F 1 -MnO x and 158 M 4 F 1 -MnO x . The reaction between PMS and MnO x in the interlayer of MnFe-LDH relied on 159 the contact of PMS with enough active sites during the mass transfer process [27, 28]. The 160 lack of MnO x induced the delayed degradation of BPA in the M 3 F 1 -MnO x /PMS and 161 M 4 F 1 -MnO x /PMS systems. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, M 2 F 1 -MnO x was chosen as 162 the research object and abbreviated as MF-MnO x . The mineralization rate of BPA was 163 measured by TOC analysis. From Fig. S4, 99.7% of BPA can be attenuated while the TOC 164 removal was 55.2% within 20 min. Prolonging the reaction time to 30 min, it can be seen that 165 81.6% of TOC removal was achieved, suggesting the sustainable degradation capacity of the 166 MF-MnO x /PMS system. 167 Journal Pre-proof

coexistence of multiple pathways is always more common than single catalytic mechanism. 183

system was investigated to determine the controlling factor of the catalytic reaction [29]. Fig.

2b exhibits the BPA removal at 15 ℃, 25 ℃ and 35 ℃, elevated temperature was found to be

beneficial to the BPA attenuation, and the reaction rate constants (k obs ) were calculated to be

0.11, 0.21 and 0.31 min$^{-1}$ at reaction temperature of 15 ℃, 25 ℃ and 35 ℃, respectively. The

inserted figure in Fig. 2b shows a linear relationship between ln(k obs ) and the reciprocal of the

reaction temperature (1/T), hence, the activation energy (E a ) for the BPA degradation was estimated as 37.9 kJ/mol through the Arrhenius equation [30]. This value exceeds the range of 10-13 kJ/mol attributed to diffusion-controlled reactions, implying that the catalytic reaction was controlled by surface chemical reaction instead of mass transfer [31]. The above results also indicate that the MnO x load was sufficient to achieve the instantaneous PMS Radical (SO 4 $^{·-}$,  $^{·}$OH) and nonradical ($^{1}$O 2 , HVM, ETP) pathways are commonly recognized in the PMS activation process [1, 6]. Especially in heterogeneous catalysis, the Journal Pre-proof

Thus, the possible RSs and oxidation processes in the MF-MnO x /PMS system were carefully 184

determined by

elaborate experiments and

characterization. Firstly,

or

pathways, including

and  $^{1}$O 2

[19].

The

ambiguous

information

compelled us

to conduct further investigation to

verify the existence of free radicals. The six characteristic peaks of DMPO-O 2 ·- and the 190

triplet signals of TEMP-$^{1}$O 2 , as shown in Fig. 3b and c, suggest the yield of O 2 $^{·-}$ and $^{1}$O 2 in 191

the MF-MnO x /PMS system [32]. Then, different RSs and oxidation processes and their 192

contribution to the BPA degradation are discussed in detail in the following sections. 193

3.3.1. Free radicals 194

Comparative experiments were performed using nitrobenzene (NB), benzoic acid (BA) 195

and atrazine (ATZ) as the probes. NB is known to be insensitive to RSs except $^{·}$OH (k [NB, ·OH] 196

= 3.9×10$^{9}$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$), while BA and ATZ, with electron-deficient structure, preferentially react 197

with  $^{·}$OH and SO 4 ·- (k [BA,·OH] = 3.9×10 9 M -1 s$^{-1}$, k [BA, SO4·-] = 1.2×10 9 M -1 s$^{-1}$, k [ATZ,·OH] = 198

2.3×10$^{9}$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, k [ATZ,SO4·-] = 2.6×10$^{9}$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) [33]. As exhibited in Fig. 3d, NB and BA were 199

stubborn in the MF-MnO x /PMS system, with less than 10% of NB and BA were eliminated 200

within 20 min reaction time. This indicates the negligible contribution of $^{·}$OH and SO 4 $^{·-}$ to 201

the BPA degradation. Surprisingly, the removal of ATZ, with similar properties to BA, 202

reached 20% under the same conditions. Therefore, the adsorption of ATZ by MF-MnO x was 203

tested, as shown in Fig. S5a, ATZ reached ad/desorption equilibrium in a very short time, and 204

Journal Pre-proof

nearly 50% of ATZ was enriched from the water phase to the catalyst surface. The result 205

provides a crucial clue that competitive occupation of active sites between PMS and 206

pollutants might occur on the catalyst surface, potentially affecting ETP induced by the 207

co-occupation of PMS and BPA at the solid-liquid interface [34]. 208

3.3.2. Singlet oxygen and superoxide radical 209

1,4 benzoquinone (BQ) possesses selective trap capability for O 2 ·- (k [BQ,O2·-] = 210

0.9-1.0×10$^{8}$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) [35, 36]. Relying on the high reactivity of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) toward 211

$^{·}$OH and $^{1}$O 2 (k [FFA, ·OH] = 1.5×10$^{10}$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$), k [FFA,1O2] = 1.2×10$^{8}$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$), FFA was employed to 212

identify the actual contribution of $^{1}$O 2 to the BPA removal [37, 38]. As depicted in Fig. S5b, 213

with 1 mM BQ and 10 mM FFA addition, the BPA removal declined to 86.1% and 64.5%, 214

and the corresponding k obs values decreased to 0.08 and 0.05 min$^{-1}$, implying the participation 215

of O 2 ·- and  $^{1}$O 2 . Considering that the direct consumption of PMS by FFA may lead to 216

misleading conclusions, the degradation of BPA by the MF-MnO x /PMS system was 217

conducted using D 2 O instead of H 2 O as the solvent [39]. The higher lifetime of $^{1}$O 2 in D 2 O 218

endows it with more active oxidation ability [40]. As illustrated in Fig. S6, the BPA 219

degradation in D 2 O was markedly elevated, with the k obs value increased from 0.21 to 0.26 220

min$^{-1}$, suggesting the crucial role of $^{1}$O 2 in the BPA removal. For O 2 $^{·-}$ with a negative redox 221

potential (-0.8 V), the direct oxidation of BPA by O 2 $^{·-}$ was insignificant [40]. Therefore, the 222

inhibition of the BPA degradation induced by scavenging O 2 $^{·-}$ deserves investigation. Oxygen 223

circulation is the link between O 2 ·- and  $^{1}$O 2 , if the BPA degradation is suppressed in an 224

oxygen-free environment, then O 2 $^{·-}$ should be the important precursors of $^{1}$O 2 [35]. As shown 225

Journal Pre-proof

in Fig. S6, the k obs value of the BPA degradation in a nitrogen saturation situation was only 226

227

0.08

min$^{-1}$,

confirming

the

origin of  $^{1}$O 2 .

Notably, the

BPA removal

in

an

anaerobic

environment still reached 84.5%, indicating that $^{1}$O 2 might not be the dominant RSs. 228

3.3.3. High valence metal (HVM) 229

HVM with strong oxidizing has been verified as a typical nonradical pathway in 230

previous studies [7]. Thus, methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) was used to detect the generated 231

high valence iron and manganese [41]. As depicted in Fig. S7, Compared with the sole PMS 232

system, the addition of MF-MnO x did not promote the removal of PMSO and the formation 233

of PMSO 2 . This result indeed excludes the participation of HVM in the BPA degradation. 234

3.3.4. Direct oxidation process (DOP) and electron transfer process (ETP) 235

Acidic PMS can trigger MnO x to oxidize organic contaminants through DOP [42]. The 236

pH fluctuation during the reaction was recorded using a hypersensitive pH meter. As tested, 237

the solution pH instantaneously declined to 3.88 with PMS addition and stabilized within plus 238

or minus 0.2 in the follow-up degradation process. Hence, the contribution of DOP was 239

simulated by maintaining the solution pH at 3.88 using 0.1 M H 2 SO 4 . As shown in Fig. 4a, 240

36.4% of BPA was eliminated by DOP within reaction time of 20 min, implying the 241

significance of the BPA oxidation induced by acidity. More importantly, the BPA degradation 242

poorly fitted the first-order kinetic model, but the reaction rate increased with prolonging the 243

reaction time. A credible explanation for this is that the confined space of MnFe-LDH 244

buffered the change in the surface chemistry micro-environment of the intercalated MnO x and 245

delayed the acidity-induced oxidation [43]. 246

Journal Pre-proof

The electron transfer between PMS and BPA induced by catalyst as electron shuttle is a 247

noteworthy nonradical degradation mechanism [6]. Firstly, the premixing experiment was 248

operated to confirm ETP. As shown in Fig. 4b, the premixing of MF-MnO x and PMS 249

promoted the BPA degradation in the early stage of the reaction, which might be related to the 250

advance of DOP. The mass transfer of PMS in the interlayer of MnFe-LDH was completed 251

during the premixing process, and BPA can be degraded immediately by acid-activated MnO x . 252

However, the premature mixing of PMS with MF-MnO x resulted in the slight inhibition of 253

the BPA degradation in the later stage of the reaction. This might be due to the self-quenching 254

of the produced $^{1}$O 2 during the premixing process. The above results indeed imply that ETP, 255

not controlled by premixing time, may be the dominant mechanism. Significantly, the 256

suppression of the BPA degradation did not enhance with prolonging the premixing time, 257

which differed from previous reports [44]. This may be related to the generation and 258

self-quenching of $^{1}$O 2 at nearly equal rate in the absence of BPA. 259

Open-circuit potential analysis was performed to identify the existence of ETP. As 260

displayed in Fig. 4c, the addition of PMS elevated the MF-MnO x potential from ~0.33 to 261

~0.37 V, indicating the formation of high-energy metastable intermediates [6]. Surprisingly, 262

the involvement of BPA did not reduce the potential of MF-MnO x as reported in previous 263

literature. For one thing, the redox potential of the metastable intermediates formed by 264

MF-MnO x and PMS was low and insufficient to capture electron from BPA [45]. For another, 265

the competitive occupation of active sites between PMS and BPA blocked the electronic 266

channel from BPA to PMS via catalyst. The PMS consumption in the MF-MnO x /PMS system 267

Journal Pre-proof

with/without BPA presence was further monitored to exclude ETP between BPA and 268

MF-MnO x -PMS intermediates. As seen in Fig. 4d, the addition of BPA hardly effected the 269

PMS decomposition, reliably supporting the conclusion obtained from the open-circuit 270

potential analysis [46]. 271

3.4. Catalytic mechanisms analysis 272

Although the aforementioned discussion verifies the secondary role of $^{1}$O 2 and DOP in 273

the BPA degradation, the dominant mechanism has been proven not to be ETP, leaving us 274

with difficulties. Therefore, there is a possibility that  $^{1}$O 2 and DOP did not exist 275

independently but cooperatively, to this end, ingenious experiments were designed to prove 276

this conjecture. 277

3.4.1 Origin of $^{1}$O 2 278

Typically, dissolved oxygen and PMS molecule are considered as the main precursors of 279

$^{1}$O 2 . Of which, the  $^{1}$O 2 production from O 2 via O 2 ·- and PMS via SO 5 ·- are recognized 280

reaction pathways [40, 47]. Although the discussion in section 3.3.2 confirmed the  $^{1}$O 2 281

evolution pathway involving O 2 and O 2 $^{·-}$, the generation of $^{1}$O 2 from PMS cannot be ruled 282

out. Thus, quantitative ESR was performed to identify the origin of $^{1}$O 2 . As shown in Fig. 5a 283

and Tab. S2, the yield of $^{1}$O 2 in the MF-MnO x /PMS system in ultrapure water was determined 284

to be 2.72×10$^{11}$ spins/mm$^{3}$ using the spins per unit volume as the index. However, with the 285

addition of 1 mM BQ, the generation of $^{1}$O 2 declined to 1.95×10$^{11}$ spins/mm$^{3}$, suggesting the 286

uniqueness of the precursor of  $^{1}$O 2 without BPA presence. Surprisingly, different from the 287

general cognition, instead of suppressing the intensity of TEMP-$^{1}$O 2 , the addition of BPA 288

Journal Pre-proof

greatly increased the generation of  $^{1}$O 2 (3.45×10 11 spins/mm$^{3}$), indicating that DOP can 289

synergistically promote the $^{1}$O 2 production while degrading BPA. Further confirmation of the 290

effect of BQ on the yield of $^{1}$O 2 with BPA involvement showed that the addition of 1 mM BQ 291

reduced the $^{1}$O 2 production of 0.86×10$^{11}$ spins/mm$^{3}$, equivalent to the $^{1}$O 2 yield from O 2 $^{·-}$ in 292

the MF-MnO x /PMS system in ultrapure water. This result implies that instead of promoting 293

the conversion of O 2 ·- to  $^{1}$O 2 , DOP triggered the generation pathway of  $^{1}$O 2 from PMS 294

295

molecule.

3.4.2 Evolution of $^{1}$O 2 from PMS 296

As mentioned in section 3.3.4, open-circuit potential analysis identified the generation of 297

the high-energy metastable MF-MnO x -PMS intermediates. Although MF-MnO x -PMS cannot 298

directly degrade BPA through ETP, the decomposition of the intermediates could result in the 299

generation of  $^{1}$O 2 through the biradical reaction between two SO 5 ·- (Eqs. 1-2) [47]. This 300

process would not reduce the open-circuit potential of MF-MnO x but generate PDS in situ, 301

leading to the confused result of the PMS decomposition (PDS possesses the same absorption 302

wavelength as PMS; 415 nm) [48]. 303

M$^{n+1}$-HSO 5 $^{-}$ → M$^{n}$-SO 5 $^{·-}$ + H$^{+}$ (1) 304

2M$^{n}$-SO 5 $^{·-}$ → M$^{n}$-S 2 O 8 $^{2-}$-M$^{n}$ + $^{1}$O 2 305

For this case, in situ-Raman was operated to confirm this process. As shown in Fig. 5b, 306

the peaks at 980 and 1086 cm$^{-1}$ can be indexed to SO 4 $^{2-}$ and the metastable MF-MnO x -PMS 307

309

(2) intermediates, suggesting the reaction between MF-MnO x and PMS [45]. Whereafter, the addition of BPA led to the blue shift of the peak representing metastable intermediates from Journal Pre-proof

to

1006

cm$^{-1}$.

It is

to

presume

that the

new

peak

can

be

attributed

to

the

MF-MnO x -PDS-MF-MnO x intermediates, which was generated simultaneously with the $^{1}$O 2

production by PMS via SO 5 $^{·-}$ [47]. Significantly, MF-MnO x was inert to the PDS activation

(Fig.

S8), indicating that

MF-MnO x -PDS-MF-MnO x

might possess

a lower

redox potential

than MF-MnO x -PMS. It also suggests that the generation of MF-MnO x -PDS-MF-MnO x from

MF-MnO x -PMS was thermodynamically feasible. 315

electron

transfer

from PMS

to MF-MnO x

was

the

initial

step to produce

SO 5 $^{·-}$, the active sites of MF-MnO x were first identified. XPS was performed to reveal the

element valence change of MF-MnO x during the catalytic reaction (Fig. 6 and Tab. S3). From Fig. 6a, the peaks at 644.8, 640.9 and 640.6 eV were related to Mn(IV), Mn(III) and Mn(II), respectively [49]. After the reaction, the relative content of the three valence of manganese changed from 19.8%, 60.9% and 19.3% to 16.2%, 71.5% and 12.3%, respectively. With regard to DOP induced by the intercalated MnO x , Mn(IV) could capture an electron from BPA leading to the BPA degradation and the increase of Mn(III) [42]. Then, BPA can be further degraded along with the reduction of Mn(III) to Mn(II) [42]. However, from the XPS Mn 2p spectrum, the relative content of Mn(II) declined instead of increasing. Therefore, the change in different valence of manganese was further accurately demonstrated by the XPS Mn 3s spectrum. As depicted in Fig. 6b, the ΔE value MF-MnO x declined from 6.2 to 6.0 eV, Journal Pre-proof

suggesting

that the

overall

valence

of

manganese

elevated

after

the

reaction,

and

the

oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III) far exceeded the conversion of Mn(III) to Mn(II) [50]. This

can be accounted for by the special bimetallic structure of MnFe-LDH, in which bimetallic

atoms bonded to the same oxygen atom can undergo a redox cycle by charge balance [51].

This point is verified by the XPS Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 6c), where peaks at 711.6 and 709.7

eV can be classified as Fe(III) and Fe(II), respectively. The catalytic reaction resulted in the

337

338

reduction of 17.1% of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Hence, the catalytic sites of MF-MnO x for the PMS

activation should be Fe(III), which was reduced to Fe(II) by capturing electrons from BPA.

The XPS O 1s spectrum further reveals the bonding between Fe(III) sites and PMS molecule. 339

As seen in Fig. 6d, the XPS O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into water molecule (O W ), 340

was further demonstrated by adding H 2 PO 4 $^{-}$ into the BPA solution [35]. As illustrated in Fig. 347

indeed verifies the absolute necessity of Fe(III)-SO 3 OOH in the PMS activation. 349

and

(O O ) [35].

Of which,

the

decrease of O O in the used MF-MnO x confirms the generation of  $^{1}$O 2 from O 2 . More importantly, 7.2% of O OH transformed into other O species, suggesting that Fe(III)-OH provided ideal coordinating sites for PMS to form the inner-sphere metastable intermediates (Fe(III)-SO 3 OOH) via the displacement of surface hydroxyl groups (Eq. 3) [50]. Since H 2 PO 4 $^{-}$ can compete with PMS for Fe(III)-OH active sites, the key role of Fe(III)-SO 3 OOH S9, the strong inhibition of H 2 PO 4 $^{-}$ on the BPA degradation by the MF-MnO x /PMS system Journal Pre-proof

To sum up, the PMS activation by MF-MnO x is illustrated in Fig. 7, Fe(III)-OH on the

However,

the

redox

potential of

Fe(III)-SO 3 OOH was insufficient to directly degrade BPA. Meanwhile, DOP induced by the

confined MF-MnO x is slightly delayed due to the buffering of the MnFe-LDH layer. Once the

mass

transfer

of PMS in

the

interlayer

of MnFe-LDH is completed, the intercalated MnO x

could degrade BPA along with the reduction of Mn(IV)/Mn(III) to Mn(II) via DOP [52]. The 358

charge imbalance in the MnFe-LDH layer triggered by excess Mn(II) in MnO x through the 359

metal-oxygen bond could result in the electron transfer from the bonded PMS to Fe(III) 360

active sites. Surface-bond SO 5 ·- generated in the process would promote the production of 361

PDS and $^{1}$O 2 via biradical reaction (Eqs. 4-5) [47]. 362

Fe(III)-SO 3 OOH → Fe(III)-SO 5 $^{·-}$ + H$^{+}$ (4) 363

2Fe(III)-SO 5 $^{·-}$ → Fe(II)-S 2 O 8 $^{2-}$-Fe(II) + $^{1}$O 2 (5) 364

To further confirm the synergism of DOP and the  $^{1}$O 2 generation, we evaluated the 365

catalytic performance of MA-MnO x and MF-LDH. As shown in Fig. S10, the k obs values of 366

the MA-MnO x /PMS and MF-LDH/PMS systems were calculated as 0.02 min and 0.03 min$^{-1}$, 367

suggesting that the efficient degradation of BPA depended on the simultaneous presence of 368

Fe(III) active site and MnO x . Moreover, the synergic coefficient (ξ) of Fe(III) active site and 369

MnO x was determined via Eq. 6 [53]. As calculated, the ξ value was 4.2, definitely verifying 370

the promotion of the $^{1}$O 2 production by DOP. 371

ξ = k obs (MF-MnO x /PMS)/(k obs (MA-MnO x /PMS)+k obs (MF-LDH/PMS)) (6) 372

Journal Pre-proof

In summary, DOP, $^{1}$O 2 from PMS activation inspired by DOP and $^{1}$O 2 produced from O 2 373

were jointly responsible for the BPA degradation. 374

3.5. Effect of key parameters 375

Effect of the solution initial pH on the BPA degradation by the MF-MnO x /PMS system 376

was investigated. As depicted in Fig. 8a and Fig. S11a, the k obs values of pH at 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 377

and 9.0 were 0.11, 0.12, 0.22 and 0.18 min$^{-1}$, respectively. The variation in environmental 378

adaptability of DOP and $^{1}$O 2 in the solution explains this trend. DOP prefers to oxidize BPA 379

under acidic condition, whereas  $^{1}$O 2 is more active in alkaline solution [54]. Although 380

adjusting the solution pH inhibited the BPA degradation, the BPA removal remained above 381

90% within the pH range of 3.0 to 9.0, suggesting the outstanding performance of the 382

MF-MnO x /PMS system over a wide pH range. In comparison to radical-based systems 383

sensitive to pH, the MF-MnO x /PMS system exhibits greater promise for the treatment of 384

micro-polluted water. 385

The effect of coexisting anions on the BPA degradation was studied, with Cl$^{-}$, CO 3 $^{2-}$ and 386

NO 3 $^{-}$ as the objects. As shown in Fig. 8b and Fig. S11, with concentration of Cl$^{-}$, CO 3 $^{2-}$ and 387

NO 3 -increasing from 1 to 100 mM, the BPA removal by the MF-MnO x /PMS system 388

consistently exceeded 90%, implying the insensitiveness of the catalytic system to the 389

environmental factors. Furthermore, the degradation efficiency of BPA was highly dependent 390

on the type and concentration of coexisting anions, especially those affecting catalyst surface 391

properties and reacting with PMS, rendering the process more unpredictable [50]. Overall, the 392

substantial influence of environmental factors on the catalytic process with multi-mechanism 393

Journal Pre-proof

deserves more attention. 394

As one of the most common substances in natural water, the effect of humic acid (HA) on 395

the BPA degradation was also performed. As depicted in Fig. S12, the existence of 1, 5, 10 396

mg/L HA suppressed the BPA removal to 58.5%, 67.1% and 73.8%. This can be explained by 397

the competitive consumption of  $^{1}$O 2 by HA, leading to the decrease of effective RSs. 398

Significantly, increased concentration of HA did not actually lead to more disastrous 399

inhibition of the BPA degradation. This can be attributed to the fact that HA with 400

electron-rich structure can promote the production of $^{1}$O 2 [55]. 401

3.6. Durability of MF-MnO x in actual water treatment 402

Since the deterioration of catalytic performance over extended use is a critical concern for 403

practical catalyst application, the cycling stability of the catalyst was examined. Given the 404

difficulty of recovering powder catalysts, we constructed a self-developed fixed-bed reactor, 405

in which MF-MnO x was encapsulated in a polymethyl methacrylate tube with quartz wool 406

(Fig. S13a). The mixed solution of PMS and BPA, prepared with Qiantang River water (Tab. 407

S4), was continuously pumped into the reactor through a peristaltic pump and then returned 408

to the beaker to achieve continuous-flow. As shown in Fig. S13b, the BPA removal 409

maintained 100% in the first 6 h, and gradually declined to 72.4% after 10 h of continuous 410

operation, suggesting the superior stability of MF-MnO x . The slight deterioration of 411

MF-MnO x might be attributed to the gradual loss of active sites during long-term use. 412

Therefore, the concentration of metal ions leaking from the catalyst was monitored during 413

each cycle. From Fig. S13b, the dissolution of metal ions from MF-MnO x decreased 414

Journal Pre-proof

gradually with prolonging the operation time, and the peak values of Fe ions and Mn ions 415

were 0.16 mg/L and 0.07 mg/L, respectively, lower than the drinking water standard of China 416

(0.3 mg/L for Fe and 0.1 mg/L for Mn). This implies that MF-MnO x might be an eco-friendly 417

catalyst for the PMS activation. 418

3.7. Degradation pathway 419

The degradation intermediates of BPA in the MF-MnO x /PMS system were analyzed by 420

the liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy-MS/MS. As shown in Figure S14a, BPA 421

## 4. Conclusion 433

Selective production of  $^{1}$O 2 from the PMS activation using low-cost metal 434 oxides/hydroxides as the catalyst was realized in this work, providing deep insights into the 435 design of highly selective catalysts. The MF-MnO x /PMS system exhibited outstanding 436 performance, with the BPA removal exceeding 99% within 20 min. The PMS activation by 437 MF-MnO x was purely dominated by nonradical pathway, and the BPA degradation was 438 attributed to DOP and its inductively produced $^{1}$O 2 . The unique confined structure of 439 MF-MnO x was proven to be the key to the special catalytic mechanism, in which the direct 440 oxidation of BPA on the intercalated MnO x induced the charge imbalance in the MnFe-LDH 441

and six degradation products can be found in the solution. Then, the degradation pathway of

BPA was proposed based on the m/z of the degradation intermediates (Figure S14b).

According to the catalytic mechanisms analysis, BPA can be degraded by two oxidation

processes, including DOP and $^{1}$O 2 . For the DOP route, an electron transferred from BPA to

MF-MnO x would lead to the formation of BPA radical, then, unstable BPA radical would rapidly split into P1 and P2 through homolytic reaction [42]. Meanwhile, P1 and P2 tended to repolymerize to P3 during the electron transfer process [45]. With regards to the $^{1}$O 2 route, under the attack of $^{1}$O 2 , the aldehydes and hydroxylation reaction occurred on the benzene ring of BPA leading to the formation P4, then, P4 would be further oxidated by  $^{1}$O 2 to produce P5 and P6 [56]. Finally, BPA could be gradually mineralized into inorganic Journal Pre-proof

layer, and the reverse transfer of electron from the bonded PMS to the catalyst led to the 442

selective production of $^{1}$O 2 . The MF-MnO x /PMS system possessed strong resistance to harsh 443

water environment, which is a promising strategy for the remediation of micro-polluted 444

water. 445
