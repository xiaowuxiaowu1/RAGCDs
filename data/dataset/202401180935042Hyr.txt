## 1. Introduction

Tetracycline (TC) is widely used in clinical and livestock practices due to its low cost and excellent effectiveness [1]. Unfortunately, TC cannot be fully absorbed in the bodies of humans or animals, and a significant portion is discharged into aquatic environments through metabolism [2]. Due to its significant ecological toxicity, even trace amounts of residual TC in water can pose substantial risks to aquatic ecosystems [3,4]. Furthermore, TC and its derivatives possess relatively stable structures, typically resistant to natural or biological degradation [5]. So, the quest for a rapid method to eliminate TC from water is of paramount importance.

Advanced oxidation processes based on persulfate (SR-AOPs) are considered effective techniques for the removal of TC and other recalcitrant organic pollutants from water bodies [6,7]. By employing specific catalytic methods, PMS can be activated to produce a significant quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · , OH · , and $^{1}$O$_{2}$, which expedite the rapid degradation of pollutants [8,9]. Nevertheless,

## ABSTRACT

Due to the serious interference of inorganic salts, it is very important to develop a peroxymonosulfate (PMS) oxidation system that can operate normally and efficiently in saline environments. Herein, the Fe-N-doped biochar flakes (FSBC) derived from sesame powder were developed with the help of molten salt strategy for activating PMS to achieve efficient degradation of tetracycline in salt environment. The effect of calcination temperature on physical and chemical properties was studied to further optimize the performance of the catalyst. FSBC-800 showed the best activation performance for PMS, with a TC removal rate of ~ 94 % within 10 min. Mechanism research shows that FSBC-800 activates PMS through singlet oxygen ($^{1}$O$_{2}$) and electron transfer, so the reaction system is extremely selective and can almost avoid interference from various inorganic ions. The FSBC-800/PMS system can operate efficiently in the coexistence of 8 common anions/cations (0 -250 mM), and salinity of 0.1 -5.0 wt% has almost no negative impact on the system. In addition, possible degradation pathways of tetracycline were proposed, and the toxicity of intermediate products during the degradation process was evaluated. This study provides a PMS oxidation system with strong selectivity that can cope with various complex saline environments.

the practical implementation of this process encounters several challenges, with one of the most prominent being the presence of various ions in real water [10]. These ions, such as Cl GLYPH<0> , HCO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> , CO$_{3}$ 2 GLYPH<0> , NO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> and H$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> often act as scavengers in the SR-AOPs system, readily reacting with radicals like SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · or OH · , leading to the formation of byproducts with low oxidation potentials [11]. Furthermore, anionic radicals like Cl · or NO$_{3}$ · , formed as a result of the reaction between Cl GLYPH<0> or NO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> with SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · or OH · , can potentially react with certain pollutants/natural organic matter, yielding corresponding chlorinated or nitrated products, posing greater environmental risks [12,13]. Compared to radical pathways, non-radical pathways such as $^{1}$O$_{2}$, electron transfer, and highvalent metal species exhibit strong selectivity, enabling SR-AOP systems based on non-radical pathways to significantly reduce the interference of anions in water matrices [14 -16]. However, for non-radical SR-AOPs systems in saline environments, there are still two significant challenges to overcome. The first challenge lies in the engineering application potential of the catalyst. It has been reported that several materials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, nanodiamonds, single-atom catalysts, and certain metal oxides, can effectively activate

PMS through non-radical pathways [17 -19]. However, these materials often struggle to strike a balance between performance and cost, with either excessive cost or insufficient performance, which hinders their practical application in engineering. The second challenge involves a thorough examination of the influence of various types and concentrations of inorganic salts on non-radical SR-AOPs systems. While some works have examined the influence of inorganic salts on SR-AOPs systems, these studies have only selected one or a few types of anions, and the concentrations are typically low [20 -25]. However, the inorganic salt concentrations in different actual wastewater vary, and the types are more complex. Therefore, for the constructed non-radical system, a more comprehensive and extensive evaluation of the influence brought by inorganic salts is necessary and important.

into the biochar during the pyrolysis process [35 -37]. Given its sustainability and cost-effectiveness, nitrogen-rich biomass emerges as an ideal precursor for nitrogen-doped biochar.

Sesame meal is the solid waste generated from the production of sesame oil through pressing [43]. It is rich in protein with a content exceeding 30 %, giving it a remarkably high nitrogen content [44]. The high nitrogen content in sesame meal sets it apart from other biomasses: nitrogen-doped biochar can be obtained without introducing external nitrogen sources (such as melamine, urea, etc.) during the pyrolysis process [45,46]. Moreover, sesame meal is readily available and costeffective, rendering it an ideal biomass precursor for the production of nitrogen-doped biochar. However, up to the present, the utilization of sesame meal has primarily been confined to areas such as feed and composting, and its potential use as a precursor for biochar needs further exploration and research [47,48]. In this work, we synthesized twodimensional flakes of iron and nitrogen co-doped biochar, which we named FSBC, in a molten salt medium using nitrogen-rich sesame oilpressing waste and iron chloride as precursors. We thoroughly investigated the physical and chemical properties of FSBC using various characterization methods. FSBC exhibited a highly effective activation performance on PMS, with the activation process being primarily governed by a non-radical pathway. Given the remarkable selectivity of non-radical pathways, we systematically examined the performance of

Besides incorporating heteroatoms and metal elements into biochar, increasing the defect level is also generally considered an effective means to improve the PMS activation performance of biochar-based materials [38]. It has been confirmed that pyrolyzing biomass in a molten salt medium can significantly increase the level of defects in biochar [39,40]. Furthermore, molten salts, in their liquid state, can easily penetrate the carbon structure of biochar, inhibiting the formation of van der Waals forces and preventing the accumulation of sp$^{2}$coordinated carbon layers [41]. This ultimately promotes the development of a thin-layered structure. Compared to structures of raw biochars, 2D thin-layer structures have a larger specific surface area, offering advantages in ensuring full contact between biochar and the liquid medium [41]. These thin-layer structures can also accelerate electron transfer during catalytic processes [37]. Thus, the employment of the molten salt strategy is a method that can significantly enhance the activation performance of biochar for PMS. It ' s important to note that molten salt can be easily washed off and recycled with distilled water [35].Compared with traditional biochar activators such as KOH and K$_{2}$CO$_{3}$, molten salt strategy more environmentally friendly and costeffective [38]. In addition, molten salt, as a high-temperature ionic melt, can enhance mass transfer processes, thereby promoting the rapid and thorough progress of the pyrolysis of biomass [42].

From the practical application standpoint, biochar emerges as a highly promising material due to its exceptional cost-effectiveness and high production yield [26,27]. Usually obtained from industrial, agricultural or household waste materials, biochar is known for its remarkably low production costs and excellent performance [28,29]. What ' s even more significant is that numerous reports have confirmed that biochar can efficiently activate PMS through various non-radical pathways. Nonetheless, the inert conjugated carbon framework of raw biochar restricts its activation performance for PMS, impeding its further application [30]. Furthermore, activation of PMS by raw biochar would produce $^{1}$O$_{2}$, a non-radical species [28]. Although $^{1}$O$_{2 }$ exhibits strong selectivity, its relatively weak oxidation ability renders it powerless against certain stubborn organic pollutants [31]. So, to achieve the efficient degradation of pollutants in saline environments, it is necessary to introduce other PMS activation pathways to biochar materials. Therefore, there is a need to explore an effective modification method to address the deficiencies in the activation performance and pathways of biochar. Co-doping with iron and nitrogen seems to offer a solution to the problems of subpar performance and activation pathways in biochar. Introducing nitrogen and iron into the carbon framework of biochar can alter the electron configuration, significantly reducing the chemical inertness of biochar and thereby greatly enhancing its activation performance [32,33]. Meanwhile, the introduction of iron and nitrogen can also introduce new PMS activation pathways to the biochar [28,34]. Introducing nitrogen into biochar is commonly achieved by copyrolyzing exogenous nitrogen (such as urea, melamine, etc.) with biomass. This approach is a double-edged sword: while it enhances the performance of biochar, the introduction of exogenous nitrogen inevitably leads to chemical pollution and increased costs [35]. In contrast, nitrogen-rich biomass (i.e., endogenous nitrogen), such as kelp, pharmaceutical sludge and soybean meal, can avoid this issue, as the abundant nitrogen elements present in the biomass can be directly integrated

the FSBC/PMS process in the presence of various coexisting ions. Finally, we proposed a degradation pathway for TC in the FSBC/PMS system and conducted an assessment of the toxicity of various intermediate products.

## 2.1. Chemicals and reagents

The reagents used in the experiment are analytical pure and can be used directly without further purification. All reagents used in this work are described in the Text S1 of Supplementary Material.

## 2.2. Synthesis of materials

In order to obtain the precursor, 10 g of pre-washed and dried sesame oil-pressing waste was mixed with 50 ml of a 3 M FeCl$_{3}$ · 6H$_{2}$O solution, and the mixture was then placed in the water bath at 90 · C, where it was kept until the moisture was completely evaporated. Subsequently, the precursor was combined with the mixed salt of KCl and LiCl (55:45) in a weight ratio of 1:3 and thoroughly ground to achieve a uniform blend. The resulting mixture is then heated at a rate of 10 · C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere until reaching the predetermined temperature (500 -900 · C), and maintained at that temperature for 2 h. Based on different temperatures, the synthesized samples were named as FSBC500, FSBC-600, FSBC-700, FSBC-800, and FSBC-900. In addition, samples synthesized under the same procedure as described above but without the addition of any Fe were named SBC-800, while samples synthesized solely by the thermal decomposition of original sesame oilpressing waste without the addition of any mixed salt or Fe were named BC-800.

## 2.3. Characterization

Details on the Characterization can be found in Text S2 in the Supplementary Material.

## 2.4. Experimental procedure

All catalytic experiments were conducted at 25 · C and 250 rpm with mechanical stirring using a 100 ml beaker containing TC solution (22.5 μ M). The pH of the TC solutions was maintained at 6.35 ± 0.1 unless specified otherwise. Prior to each experiment, a fresh TC stock solution (45 μ M) was prepared. Typically, a specific quantity of catalyst was introduced into 50 ml of deionized water and stirred for ten minutes to ensure even dispersion. Subsequently, 50 ml of the 45 μ M TC stock solution and a predetermined amount of PMS were added to initiate the degradation experiment. At specified time intervals, 2 ml of the reaction solution were withdrawn and the reaction was terminated by adding 0.1 M Na$_{2}$S$_{2}$O$_{3}$. The reaction mixture was then filtered using a Nylon 66 syringe filter and analyzed with a UV -Vis spectrophotometer (Metash, UV-8000).

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Characterization

The phase composition of biochars synthesized in this work was characterized through XRD analysis. As depicted in Fig. S1a, five different phases were identified in the FSBC samples, namely Fe$_{5}$C$_{2, }$ Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$, KCl, SiO$_{2}$, and LiMgPO$_{4}$. Fe$_{5}$C$_{2 }$ and Fe$_{2}$O$_{3 }$ formed from

introduced iron salts during pyrolysis, while SiO$_{2 }$and KCl are speculated to originate from impurities in the sesame meal or residual molten salt. LiMgPO$_{4 }$ is intriguing, as this compound is likely formed through a complex reaction during the pyrolysis process, involving LiCl from the molten salt, along with proteins and magnesium from the sesame meal. These inferences are corroborated by the XRD spectra of the raw biochar (BC-800) and the biochar synthesized solely with molten salt assistance (SBC-800). As illustrated in Fig. S1b, the presence of SiO$_{2 }$ in BC-800 suggests that SiO$_{2 }$ originates from impurities in the sesame meal. Additionally, the appearance of KCl and LiMgPO$_{4 }$ phases in the spectrum of SBC-800 indicates that KCl and LiMgPO$_{4 }$indeed derive from the molten salt and sesame meal.

The defect level of the samples was revealed by Raman spectroscopy. Peaks located near 1350 and 1574 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in the carbon material can be assigned to the D band of disordered carbon and the G band of graphitic carbon. In general, the higher the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (I$_{D}$/I$_{G}$), the higher the defect level of the sample. As shown in Fig. 1c, with increasing temperature, the I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ of samples initially increased and then decreased. FSBC-800 has the highest I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ ratio, which is 1.11, indicating that FSBC-800 has the most defect sites. The increasing temperature can accelerate the molecular motion of the molten salt, intensifying its corrosion and destroy on carbon lattice and resulting in the formation of more defect sites [39]. However, excessively high temperatures (900 · C) may cause rapid evaporation of the molten salt, which could be a possible reason for the defects of samples initially increasing and then decreasing. In addition, the defect level of the material was also influenced by the mixed salt and iron salts during pyrolysis. As shown in Fig. 1d, the I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ratio for BC-800 and SBC-800 are 1.04 and 1.07, while FSBC-800 has a ratio of 1.11. This indicates that both molten salt and FeCl$_{3 }$can increase the defect level of biochar, and the two work together during the pyrolysis process, thus increasing the defect level of the material.

FTIR analysis is employed to examine the surface chemical properties of samples. By referring to Fig. 1a, several key functional groups can be identified. The broad bands observed around 3420 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$indicate the presence of GLYPH<0> OH groups in the samples, which may originate from surface hydroxyls groups of biochar or iron oxides [49,50]. Asymmetric and symmetric stretching was observed for aliphatic GLYPH<0> CH and GLYPH<0> CH$_{2 }$at 2919 and 2858 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, and the intensity of this peak is usually closely related to the pyrolysis temperature of biochar [51,52]. The 1610 cm GLYPH<0> 1 peaks correspond to the stretching vibration of C = O bonds, typically found in carboxyl or carbonyl groups [53]. The significance of C = O in biochar is self-evident, as it is commonly regarded as one of the active sites for PMS, effectively activating PMS to generate $^{1}$O$_{2 }$[54 -56]. The sample exhibits the peak at 1434 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, signifying the presence of C GLYPH<0> C bonds. Vibration at 1087 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$is attributed to C GLYPH<0> O (found in esters, ethers, or carboxylic acids) or C GLYPH<0> N, and it was observed that as the pyrolysis temperature increased, the intensity of this peak continued to decrease. The characteristic peak of metal oxides in biochar can be found at 593 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which represents the stretching vibration of the M GLYPH<0> O bonds of the metal oxides. Notably, the spectra of SBC-800 and BC800 (Fig. 1b) also display these peaks, indicating that variables such as molten salt, Fe, or temperature would not induce the formation of new functional groups.

SEM was employed to investigate the influence of molten salt and FeCl$_{3 }$ on the morphological structure of the samples. As depicted in Fig. 2a, sesame cake underwent thermal decomposition at 800 · C, resulting in the formation of a solid, three-dimensional block-like structure. When molten salt was introduced as an activator (SBC-800), the surface of block-shaped biochar exhibited signs of being cut and corroded, leading to an overall looser structure (Fig. 2b), and thin flakelike edges and porous structures were beginning to form. The introduction of FeCl$_{3 }$is anticipated to intensify material corrosion and cutting, because FeCl$_{3 }$can act as an in-situ template and catalyst during the pyrolysis of biochar, facilitating the growth of flake-like nanostructures [57]. Therefore, after further introduction of FeCl$_{3}$, the biomass

underwent more intense corrosion and cutting under the combined effect of iron salt and molten salt, ultimately resulting in the stripping of two-dimensional biochar nanosheets (i.e., namely FSBC-800) (Fig. 2c). The analysis results obtained from EDS indicate that FSBC-800 is primarily composed of C, Fe, O, and N (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, these elements exhibit a uniform distribution on the surface of the sample, providing evidence that Fe and N have been successfully incorporated into the material. The TEM image of FSBC-800 was shown in Fig. S2, and no distinct lattice fringes were observed, indicating the presence of a significant amount of disordered carbon structures in FSBC-800. An increase in disordered carbon structures in biochar typically signifies a higher degree of defects, which is consistent with the observations from the Raman spectra.

The C 1 s spectra ( Fig. 3b and Fig. S3b) of all samples exhibited three distinct peaks corresponding to C = C/C GLYPH<0> C (284.8 eV), C GLYPH<0> O/C GLYPH<0> N (285.8 eV), and C = O/O GLYPH<0> C = O (288.8 eV) [58]. The O 1 s spectra of the Fe-containing samples (FSBC) could be deconvoluted into three distinct

XPS was employed to investigate the elemental valence states and composition of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 3, the elemental distribution in different samples revealed that with increasing temperature, the Fe content in the sample gradually increased, while the N content decreased. This trend became more pronounced at higher temperatures (800 -900 · C). The rise in Fe content is speculated to be attributed to the heightened reactivity between Fe and the organic precursor due to the temperature increase. Conversely, the reduction in N content may be ascribed to the gasification and decomposition of organic nitrogen species (e.g., protein) in the precursor induced by high temperatures. Furthermore, in comparison to SBC800 and BC-800, the introduction of Fe element also led to a reduction in the N content of FSBC-800 (Fig. S3a).

peaks (Fig. 3c), attributed to M GLYPH<0> O (530.2 eV), C = O/C GLYPH<0> O GLYPH<0> C (531.6 eV), and C GLYPH<0> O (532.8 eV) [59]. In contrast, the iron-free samples SBC-800 and BC-800 lacked the M GLYPH<0> O peak, while the remaining peaks aligned with those observed in the iron-containing samples (Fig. S3c). Fig. 3d and Fig. S3d illustrate the N 1 s fine spectrum of the samples, which could be deconvoluted into three distinct peaks: graphitic nitrogen (401.2 eV), pyrrole nitrogen (400.0 eV), and pyridine nitrogen (398.3 eV) [36]. As the temperature increased, the proportion of pyridine nitrogen gradually decreased, while the proportion of graphitic nitrogen increased, suggesting that higher temperatures promote the conversion of pyridine nitrogen into graphitic nitrogen. Additionally, in comparison to SBC-800 and BC-800, the proportion of graphitic nitrogen in FSBC800 increased significantly, indicating that the introduction of Fe could promote the conversion of other nitrogen species into graphitic nitrogen. Graphitic nitrogen is known for its relatively higher thermal stability compared to other nitrogen species, a characteristic that enables it to modify the electronic properties of the inert carbon lattice, thereby enhancing the activation activity of PMS [60]. The Fe 2p deconvolution of each sample is depicted in Fig. 3e, and all samples consist of both Fe(II) and Fe(III). It was observed that the proportion of Fe(II) exhibited a slight increase with rising pyrolysis temperature, which may be caused by the high temperature promoting the carbothermal reduction reaction between biochar and iron salt.

The adsorption -desorption isotherms for FSBC-800, SBC-800, and BC-800 are displayed in Fig. S4a. It is evident that all three sample sets exhibit similar type IV adsorption -desorption isotherms. The pore size distribution shows that both BC-800 and SBC-800 are mainly mesopores, while FSBC-800 has changed to mainly micropores (Fig. S4b). Furthermore, the specific surface areas of FSBC-800, SBC-800, and BC-800 are 31.303, 11.543, and 4.356 m$^{2}$/g, indicating that the introduction of

molten salt and iron salt could increase the specific surface area of biochar. Additionally, the VSM curves (Fig. S5) demonstrate that due to the introduction of iron salt, FSBC-800 changed from its original antiferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state, which is undoubtedly beneficial to solid -liquid separation.

## 3.2. Effect of reaction parameters

The influence of pyrolysis temperature on the activation performance of catalysts for PMS was firstly investigated. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the activation performance of FSBC exhibited an initial increase followed by a decrease. In descending order of pyrolysis temperature, the k$_{obs }$ of several samples are 0.7365, 0.8975, 0.5452, 0.3494, and 0.0865 min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$(Fig. S6). Due to the best PMS activation performance, FSBC-800 was selected for subsequent research. On the other hand, the activation performance is also significantly influenced by the introduction of molten salt and iron salt. BC-800, SBC-800 and FSBC-800 exhibited the degradation efficiencies of 52.2 %, 77.8 %, and 94.1 % for TC (Fig. 4c), and the corresponding k$_{obs }$ are 0.0694, 0.1382 and 0.8975 min GLYPH<0> 1 (Fig. S7). This demonstrates that the introduction of molten salt and iron salt contributes to the enhancement of the activation performance of biochar for PMS. In addition, to exclude false positive results generated by catalyst adsorption and PMS alone oxidizing TC, the removal of TC was examined in cases where only PMS or FSBC800 was present. Fig. 4c illustrates that in the FSBC-800/PMS system, approximately 94 % of TC was rapidly removed within 10 min. This removal rate was significantly higher than that of FSBC-800 alone (~38 %) or PMS alone (~30 %). The k$_{obs }$ values in the FSBC-800/PMS system

were 14 times higher than FSBC-800 alone and 26 times higher than PMS oxidation alone, indicating that the efficient activation of PMS by FSBC-800 was the primary reason for the rapid removal of TC in the system.

The influence of the initial pH on the reaction system was shown in Fig. 5c. It can be observed that the initial pH exhibited a negligible effect on the reaction system. Monitoring the pH changes revealed that when the initial pH ranged from 5 to 9, the addition of PMS led to the rapid decreases in the pH of reaction systems to approximately 3 (Fig. S8). Therefore, it is not surprising that the reaction system exhibited nearly identical degradation efficiency for TC at different initial pH values. When the initial pH was 11, the degradation efficiency of TC exhibited a slight decrease compared to other initial pH. It can be observed that the pH of the system decreased from 11 to around 8.5 rapidly after the addition of PMS, and then gradually decreased to approximately 4 due to the decomposition of PMS. It is speculated that the slight decrease in the degradation efficiency of TC at this pH is due to the change in catalyst surface potential caused by pH change.

Fig. 5a presents the influence of catalyst concentration on the degradation of TC in the system. A clear positive correlation exists between catalyst concentration and the efficiency of TC degradation. The PMS concentration and the degradation of TC also showed a similar trend, and the degradation effect of TC continued to increase with the increase of PMS concentration (Fig. 5b). Considering the cost and performance, the final selection of a catalyst dosage at 0.4 g/L and a PMS concentration at 1 mM.

The influence of temperature on the FSBC-800/PMS process was also checked. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the degradation efficiencies of TC

significantly increased with rising temperature, indicating the endothermic nature of the activation reaction. The k$_{obs }$ values increased from 0.4254 min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$to 1.2537 min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$as the reaction temperature increased from 15 · C to 45 · C (Fig. S9). By employing the Arrhenius equation and the collected data, the activation energy (E$_{a}$) for the reaction was calculated and determined to be 26.0427 kJ/mol (Fig. S10).

## 3.3. Identification of reactive oxygen species

Quenching experiments and EPR were employed to investigate the contributions of various ROS. EtOH and TBA were employed to identify the potential SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · and OH · . Ethanol (EtOH) exhibits remarkably strong reactivity for both SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · · , while tert -butanol (TBA) displays a high reactivity specifically for OH · [8]. As shown in Fig. 6a, the presence of EtOH and TBA in the system exhibited negligible inhibition on the degradation of TC. In the SR-AOPs system containing sufficient radicals, adding EtOH or TBA often substantially lowers the efficiency of pollutant degradation due to their quenching effects [63]. However, in the FSBC-800/PMS system, the addition of EtOH and TBA has virtually no impact on the degradation of TC. This observation indicates that the contribution of SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · and OH · to the degradation of TC in the system was almost negligible. This finding was further substantiated by EPR, employing 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap agent for capturing SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · and OH · [64]. If the system contains a sufficient amount of SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · · , DMPO can capture these radicals, forming DMPO GLYPH<0> SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · and DMPO GLYPH<0> OH · signals with specific patterns [65]. As depicted in Fig. 6b, upon the introduction of DMPO into the reaction system, no signals corresponding to the DMPO GLYPH<0> SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · and DMPO GLYPH<0> OH · adducts were observed. Instead, the signal of 5 -tert-butoxycarbonylmethyl-2-oxo-pyrroline-1-oxyl (DMPOX) was distinctly detected throughout the entire reaction process. In the SR-AOPs system, the emergence of the DMPOX signal can currently be attributed to two potential explanations. The first possibility is the sustained oxidation of DMPO by an excess of radicals present in the system [66]. The second possibility involves the oxidation of DMPO through one or multiple nonradical pathways [67]. Upon the addition of methanol, which is known to scavenge SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · and OH · , into the system, it is noteworthy that the DMPOX signal continued to be detected without any significant change

The reusability of FSBC-800 was also examined. The FSBC-800/PMS system was able to degrade over 80 % of TC within 10 min for the first three cycles (Fig. S11). Even at the fifth cycle, it maintained over 70 % removal of TC within the same duration. The reduced activation performance after reuse could be attributed to the adsorption of TC or its transformation products onto the active sites of FSBC-800, thus obstructing these sites [61,62]. Moreover, the leaching of FSBC-800 after the reaction was also monitored. As shown in Fig. S12, the supernatant after reaction revealed concentrations of 437.8 μ g/L of iron, 80.1 μ g/L of silicon, and 3807.9 μ g/L of magnesium. The leached iron originated from the iron species formed during the preparation of FSBC-800, while leached silicon and magnesium were derived from the precursor, sesame meal. It should be noted that the leached concentrations of these elements were well below the related environmental protection standards, affirming that FSBC-800 is a sustainable catalyst. The activation effect of leached iron on PMS was also examined, as illustrated in Fig. S13. It can be observed that leached iron at the leaching level has a weak activation effect on PMS, degrading approximately 45 % of TC within 10 min. This value is only 15 % higher than using PMS alone, and significantly lower than the 94 % achieved by the FSBC-800/PMS process. Therefore, the TC degradation in the FSBC-800/PMS system is attributed to FSBC-800 rather than leached iron.

in intensity. This observation dismisses the possibility of excess radicals and supports the existence of one or more non-radical pathways in the FSBC-800/PMS system. Additionally, O$_{2}$ GLYPH<0> · , as a special radical, its contribution to TC degradation also needs to be clarified. Due to the ultra-high reaction rate with O$_{2}$ GLYPH<0> · , chloroform (CF) was employed to scavenge O$_{2}$ GLYPH<0> · from the system [68]. It was observed that the addition of CF had almost no inhibition on the degradation of TC (Fig. 6a), which indicates the absence of O$_{2}$ GLYPH<0> · in the system.

degradation of TC in the system.

Catalyst-mediated electron transfer is a unique non-radical activation pathway for PMS, which has been widely reported to effectively and rapidly degrade some electron-rich organic pollutants [16,71]. Electrochemical characterizations are considered an effective method to identify the catalyst-mediated electron transfer pathway [72]. The chronoamperometry (i-t) curve was utilized to identify the presence of the electron transfer pathway in the system (Fig. 6d). It is observed that upon the addition of PMS, there was a significant negative current in the system, indicating the formation of a complex between the catalyst and PMS. Subsequently, with the introduction of TC, a significant positive current was observed, which is a typical sign of electron transfer between TC and PMS mediated by the catalyst [73]. The results of the i-t curve indicate the presence of electron transfer pathway in the system. The monitoring of changes in open-circuit potential provides additional support for this point. As depicted in Fig. 6e, after PMS addition, the open-circuit potential shows the upward trend due to the formation of PMS complexes on the catalyst surface. The introduction of TC caused the potential to drop instantaneously, and this observation further confirmed the existence of electron transfer pathway in the system [74]. The (linear sweep voltammetry) LSV curves also confirmed the presence of electron transfer pathway. In comparison to the system containing only PMS, the addition of TC resulted in a significant change in current

The high-valent metal species, such as high valent iron-oxo species (Fe(IV) = O), as a non-radical pathway, need verification regarding their presence in the FSBC-800/PMS system. Due to the strong reactivity with high-valent metal species, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was employed to quench any potential high valent metal species present in the system [70]. The addition of DMSO had minimal effect on the reaction system, suggesting the absence of high-valent metal substances like Fe(IV) = O (Fig. 6a).

As a unique non-radical pathway, $^{1}$O$_{2 }$is generally considered to play an important role in the degradation process of certain organic pollutants [2]. Therefore, the role of $^{1}$O$_{2 }$needs to be clarified in the FSBC-800/ PMS system. Furfuryl alcohol (FFA) was employed as a scavenger of $^{1}$O$_{2 }$ in the system, owing to its highly reactivity for $^{1}$O$_{2 }$[15]. As shown in Fig. 6a, the addition of 10 mM FFA led to a notable reduction in TC degradation, and the TC degradation decreased from the initial 94.1 % to 59.7 %. However, it has been reported that FFA can react directly with PMS, leading to the consumption of PMS in the system, which may cause false-positive results [69]. Therefore, in order to address this concern, the consumption of PMS by FFA was carefully monitored. In the absence of a catalyst, no significant consumption of PMS by FFA was observed (Fig. S14) This observation suggests the presence of an amount of $^{1}$O$_{2 }$in the system. EPR was also used to characterize the presence of $^{1}$O$_{2}$, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone (TEMP) was chosen as the spintrapping agent for capturing $^{1}$O$_{2}$. As depicted in Fig. 6c, distinct signals of 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) were observed in the FSBC-800/PMS system. As a control, a signal of TEMPO was also detected at the same time point in the system containing only PMS, but its intensity was considerably lower compared to the FSBC-800/PMS system, which provides the evidence for the existence of $^{1}$O$_{2 }$in the reaction system. In summary, the results of quenching experiments and EPR tests prove that  $^{1}$O$_{2 }$ makes an important contribution to the

Separation and Purification Technology 337 (2024) 126378 Han et al.

(Fig. 6f), which suggests that electron transfer pathway played the important role in the reaction system [60]. To sum up, the degradation of TC in the FSBC-800/PMS system mainly relied on two non-radical pathways, namely $^{1}$O$_{2 }$and catalyst-mediated electron transfer.

## 3.4. Factors affecting performance of the catalyst

To investigate the reasons behind the exceptional catalytic performance of FSBC, we examined the correlation of TC degradation rate constants with various factors that may affect FSBC performance. As shown in Fig. 7, the iron and nitrogen content, as well as related species like Fe(II) and graphitic nitrogen, exhibit a weak correlation with the k$_{obs}$ , suggesting that these species may not be the primary active sites of FSBC. Although iron and nitrogen might not directly partake in the reaction, their role cannot be disregarded. Their influence on the structure and chemical properties of biochar would significantly enhance the activation performance [75 -77]. In contrast to other elemental contents, the strong correlation between C content and k$_{obs }$ (R$^{2 $_{=}$}$0.8316) suggests that the activation of PMS by FSBC primarily depends on its carbon

I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ shows a significant correlation with k (R 2 $_{=}$ 0.9501), which indicates that I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$is a key factor affecting the activation performance of FSBC. I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ratios can often serve as indicators of the extent of defects in biochar, and the strong correlation observed suggests that the activation performance of FSBC is closely linked to its defect level. Defect sites in carbon materials are typically regarded as possessing high activity and can even assume a dominant role [78]. Specifically, defects on the carbon network are active centers that mediate PMS activation to form complexes for nonradical oxidation. These defect sites can confine the delocalized π system in a " localized state " and exhibit completely different chemical and electronic properties, allowing strong interactions with pollutants [79]. This strong interaction enables PMS molecules to directly oxidize pollutants by extracting electrons from adsorbed pollutants. Therefore, defects in FSBC can serve as active sites for the activation pathway of electron transfer. In addition, the C = O/ O GLYPH<0> C = O content also shows a strong correlation with k$_{obs }$ (R$^{2 $_{=}$}$0.8427). C = O is also widely recognized for its significant role in PMS activation due to its electron-rich nature [80]. It is reported that C = O is the active

site for $^{1}$O$_{2 }$generation, which can directly donate electrons to PMS to generate  $^{1}$O$_{2 }$ [55]. In view of the strong correlation between C = O/ O GLYPH<0> C = O content and k$_{obs}$ , the C = O group in FSBC can be considered as the active site for activating PMS to generate  $^{1}$O$_{2}$. In summary, the excellent activation performance of FSBC-800 comes from more defects and C = O sites, which allows it to activate PMS through the electron transfer and $^{1}$O$_{2 }$pathways.

The XPS spectra obtained both before and after the reaction provide compelling evidence that the activity of FSBC-800 primarily originates from its carbon structure rather than from nitrogen, iron, or other species. As depicted in Fig. 8a and b, the proportion of various iron or nitrogen species in the used FSBC-800 did not exhibit the significant transformation, suggesting that iron or nitrogen did not serve as the primary sites for PMS activation. The role played by the C = O group of FSBC-800 in the PMS activation process was also revealed by the O 1 s spectra before and after the reaction. As depicted in Fig. 8c and d, a noticeable shift in the proportion of C = O/O GLYPH<0> C = O or C = O/C GLYPH<0> O GLYPH<0> C was observed, which strongly suggest that C = O indeed serves as one of the reactive sites for PMS activation. The FTIR analysis throughout the entire reaction process further substantiates the crucial role played by

C = O (Fig. 8e). As the reaction progressed, the C = O bond at 1610 cm GLYPH<0> 1 exhibited noticeable splitting in the lower wavenumber direction, suggesting a red-shift in the C = O bond peak. This red-shift is indicative of an increase in the electron density of the C = O group, signifying that the C = O group continued to donate electrons to PMS throughout the activation process. The C = O group of carbon-based material in SR-AOP is believed to contribute to the generation of  $^{1}$O$_{2}$, which has been confirmed by a large number of reports [54 -56]. On the other hand, the Raman spectra validate the significance of defective sites in the reaction process. As depicted in Fig. 8f, the initial I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ ratio for the pristine sample was 1.11. As the reaction commenced, the I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ratio gradually decreased, eventually reaching 0.94. This decrease serves as a compelling indicator that the defect is one of the primary active sites of FSBC800 for PMS activation. The lower electron density of defect sites allowed them to adsorb electron-rich PMS and pollutants, thereby contributing the electron transfer between pollutants and PMS [79]. Based on the aforementioned analysis and discussion, a mechanism for the activation of PMS by FSBC-800 is proposed. FSBC-800 primarily activates PMS through two pathways: (i). PMS interacted with C = O on the surface of FSBC-800, causing its own cleavage to produce $^{1}$O$_{2}$. (ii).

The abundant defect sites on FSBC-800 allow it to adsorb both TC and PMS onto its surface. Subsequently, FSBC-800 acted as an electron bridge, facilitating the transfer of electrons from TC to PMS, thereby completing the degradation of TC.

## 3.5. Degradation pathway and the toxicity evaluation

The intermediate products generated during the TC degradation process was detected by mass spectrometry (Fig. S15). A total of 12 TC degradation intermediate products were identified and listed in Table S1. Based on the identified intermediate products, the possible degradation pathways of TC were proposed. As shown in Fig. 9a, there are two main degradation pathways of TC in the FSBC-800/PMS system. In Pathway 1, the transformation of TC commenced with the hydroxylation step, resulting in the generation of P1 ( m / z = 475.2). This marked transformation was followed by the detachment of an amino group from P1, forming the intermediary P2 ( m / z = 460.2). Subsequent transformations involved decarbonylation and demethylation of P2, leading to the formation of P3 ( m / z = 418.2). Subsequently, under the

vigorous onslaught of ROS in the reaction system, P3 underwent ring opening, which in turn led to the formation of P4 ( m / z = 362.2). With the continuous oxidation by the reaction system, the ring of P4 was further opened, and finally P5 ( m / z = 274.3) was formed. In Pathway 2, TC underwent the demethylation and hydroxylation occurring at multiple sites, resulting in the transformation into P6 ( m / z = 437.2). Subsequently, P6 was further hydroxylated and, concomitantly, underwent an addition reaction at the same sites, leading to the formation of P7 ( m / z = 453.3). Subsequent transformations involve dehydration and decarbonylation occurring at multiple sites in P7, ultimately leading to the formation of P8 ( m / z = 393.2). The products from both pathways with large molecular weight, under the sustained oxidation in the reaction system, eventually were transformed into smaller-molecularweight products, including P9 ( m / z = 198.1), P10 ( m / z = 186.2), P11 ( m / z = 113.0), and P12 ( m / z = 74.0). These products were finally mineralized into some inorganic products in the system, such as CO$_{2}$, and H$_{2}$O [81].

Based on the QSAR method, the TEST software was employed for the toxicity assessment of TC and its transformation products (The detailed

evaluation results are compiled in Table S2). The QSAR method based on TEST software has been considered a reliable method to evaluate the toxicity of organic matter transformation products [82]. The results indicate that the toxicity of some intermediate products was significantly reduced compared to TC, and even the toxicity of few products had reduced to a harmless level. But there were still some products whose toxicity increased compared TC. For Fathead minnow LC50 (Fig. 9b), there was an increased toxicity in P5, while for Daphnia magna LC50 (Fig. 9c), the toxicity of P8 was elevated. Concerning Oral rat LD50 (Fig. 9d), the escalation in toxicity was observed for P1, P2, P7, P8 and P12. In terms of bioaccumulation factors (Fig. 9e), compared to TC, an increase was observed in P6, P7, and P10, whereas the remaining products showed a decrease. Regarding developmental toxicity (Fig. 9f), only P5 exhibited an increase in developmental toxicity compared to TC, while the developmental toxicity of the other products decreased. Notably, P9 and P11 even became developmental non-toxicant. Of particular significance is the mutagenicity of the intermediate products (Fig. 9g). Compared to TC, an increase in mutagenicity was observed for P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P11, while only P5, P9, P10, and P12 exhibited reduced mutagenicity, transitioning into mutagenicity negative. In conclusion, during the degradation process of TC, the generation

of certain products with higher toxicity was observed. However, there is no need for excessive concern, as these products would ultimately transform into less toxic products or be mineralized into non-toxic inorganic compounds, facilitated by the continued progress of the degradation process [83,84].

## 3.6. Performance in saline environment

In actual wastewater, various inorganic ions are commonly present, and these ions would significantly affect the performance of SR-AOPs. To examine the performance of the FSBC-800/PMS system in practical situations, a total of eight ions with different concentrations were respectively added to the reaction system.

In the traditional system dominated by radical pathway, Cl GLYPH<0> can react with SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · or OH · , resulting in the formation of secondary chlorine radicals (such as Cl · , Cl$_{2}$ GLYPH<0> · , and ClOH GLYPH<0> · ) with lower oxidation potential (Eqs. (1) -(3) [85]. This would result in an obvious inhibition on the degradation of pollutants. However, due to the high selectivity of $^{1}$O$_{2 }$ and electron transfer, this inhibition was not observed within the FSBC800/PMS system. Fig. 10a clearly indicates that the presence of Cl GLYPH<0> in concentrations ranging from 2 to 250 mM had no inhibition on the

Fig. 10. Removal of TC under different concentrations of (a) Cl GLYPH<0> , (b) CO$_{3}$ 2 GLYPH<0> , (c) HCO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> , (d) SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> , (e) H$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> , (f) NO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> , (g) Ca 2 + , (h) Mg 2 + and (i) Removal of TC in CoCu10/PMS system at different salinity. Reaction conditions: [TC] = 22.5 μ M, [Catalyst] = 0.40 g/L, [PMS] = 1.0 mM, [Temperature] = 25 · C and [initial pH] was unadjusted.

Separation and Purification Technology 337 (2024) 126378 Han et al.

degradation of TC. It is noteworthy that at high concentrations (250 mM), there was a significant acceleration in the degradation of TC in the system, which can be attributed to the direct reaction between Cl GLYPH<0> and PMS, leading to the generation of HOCl (Eqs. (11)-(13)) [86].

Similarly, HCO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> and CO$_{3}$ 2 GLYPH<0> can effectively scavenge radicals such as SO$_{4}$ GLYPH<0> · and OH · , resulting in the formation of HCO$_{3}$ · or CO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> · with a lower oxidation potential (Eqs. (3) and (4) [14]. In the FSBC-800/PMS system, the presence of CO$_{3}$ 2 GLYPH<0> or HCO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> in concentrations ranging from 0 to 250 mM had minimal effect on TC degradation (Fig. 10b and 10c). The FSBC800/PMS system also exhibited a strong resistance to varying concentrations of SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> or H$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> . As depicted in Fig. 10d and e, the inhibition on the reaction system due to SO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> or H$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ 2 GLYPH<0> ranging from 2 to 250 mM were negligible. Furthermore, NO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> can also pose inhibitory effects on radicals dominated processes through similar scavenging mechanisms (Eq. (6), while FSBC-800/PMS system, as a non-radical system, would not be affected by this [87]. As depicted in Fig. 10f, within the concentration range of 0 to 250 mM, no inhibition on the FSBC-800/PMS system by NO$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> was observed. 2

To assess the effectiveness of the FSBC-800/PMS process in real saline wastewater, the reef salt (The composition of this mixed salt is detailed in Table S3) was employed as the substitution for inorganic salt in real saline wastewater. As depicted in Fig. 10i, the FSBC-800/PMS process demonstrated exceptional performance at the salinity ranging from 0.1 to 5 wt%. Salinity levels below 1 wt% exhibited insignificant inhibition on TC degradation in the system, whereas salinity exceeding 3 wt% actually accelerated the degradation of TC. This acceleration can be attributed to two factors: firstly, the reaction between Cl GLYPH<0> and PMS leading to the generation of HOCl; secondly, the bridging effect of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions in the reef salt. In summary, the FSBC-800/PMS process was demonstrated to operate efficiently under varying salinity conditions, which highlights the robust performance of the FSBC-800/PMS process. In addition, the performance of the FSBC-800/PMS process was also checked in real water. As shown in Fig. S16, the TC removal rate of the FSBC-800/PMS process in tap water, river water, and pond water matrices was similar to that in deionized water, which proves the practical potential of the FSBC-800/PMS process.

Furthermore, two cations, Ca 2 + and Mg + , were not observed to have any negative effects on the FSBC-800/PMS system (Fig. 10g and 10 h). Conversely, higher concentrations of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + significantly enhanced the degradation of TC in the system, which may be due to the bridging role of the two cations. As reported, these cations are known to possess substantial hydration shell thickness, allowing them to act as bridging agents between HSO$_{5}$ GLYPH<0> ions and metal sites [88,89]. This bridging effect enhanced the interaction between PMS and metal sites, subsequently accelerating the activation of PMS by catalysts.

## 4. Conclusion

Using sesame cake as a precursor, iron -nitrogen-doped twodimensional biochar flakes were successfully synthesized via a molten salt strategy. The optimized FSBC-800 exhibited excellent catalytic performance in activating PMS, with a degradation efficiency of ~ 94 % for TC within 10 min. Characterization and analysis results indicated that defects and C = O groups were the primary active sites on FSBC-800.

FSBC-800 activated PMS through both singlet oxygen and electron transfer mechanisms, enabling the oxidation system based on FSBC-800 to exhibit high selectivity. This selectivity allows the FSBC-800/PMS process to greatly avoid the adverse effects of various common inorganic salts in water. This work provides a new perspective on low-cost and efficient treatment of pollutants in saline environments.
