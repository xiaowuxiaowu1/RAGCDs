## ABSTRACT

Atomically dispersed Fe-N-C catalysts are a promising alternative to platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, attaining efficient ORR activity and superior stability in Fe-N-C catalysts is still crucial yet challenging. Herein, we report a rational SiO$_{2}$-mediated two-step pyrolysis strategy for stabilizing densely exposed Fe-N$_{4 }$active sites on hierarchically porous carbon (HP-Fe-N-C/2). Benefiting from the high density of accessible Fe-N$_{4 }$sites and the high graphitization degree of carbon support, the obtained HPFe-N-C/2 catalyst demonstrates outstanding activity and stability for ORR in both alkaline and acidic media. When used as the cathode catalyst, the assembled Zn-air battery shows a high peak power density of 217 mW cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$and ultra-long cycling stability for 1342 h without noticeable degradation. As a PGM-free cathode in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, it delivers a maximum output power density of 0.66 W cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$.

## 1. Introduction

With increasing energy demand and environmental pollution problem, developing clean energy technologies is critical such as solar, wind, and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, solar and wind energy are highly dependent on the weather, and their energy conversion forms are unstable. LIBs are still limited by the insufficient energy density and safety issues. Compared to above energy technologies, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have many standing advantages of high efficiency, high energy density, zero carbon emissions, and fast refueling. Zn-air batteries (ZABs) can offer high power density (ca. 1086 Wh/ kg), environmental friendliness, and intrinsic safety. In this context, PEMFCS and ZABs are outstanding candidates for sustainable energy conversion [1 -4]. However, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) taking place at cathode of PEMFCS and ZABs is kinetically sluggish originated from the multi-electron processes and problematic activation/cleavage

of O = O bond, which seriously restricts the large-scale application of PEMFCS and ZABs [5 -7]. Up to now, PGM catalysts have been regarded as generally efficient catalysts to accelerate ORR [8,9]. However, the high price and scarcity of PGM catalysts greatly limit their large-scale commercialization [10 -13]. Therefore, for the widespread application of ZABs and PEMFCs, exploring high-performance and earth-abundant PGM-free catalysts has become a key research direction [14 -20].

To date, atomically dispersed Fe-N-C catalysts possess the highest ORR performance among the various PGM-free catalysts [18,21,22]. Atomic Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites have been confirmed as active sites for ORR by theoretical and experimental studies [23 -26]. Thus, increasing the density of Fe-N$_{4 }$sites is an effective strategy to boost ORR activity. In general, the density of Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites in Fe-N-C catalysts is typically increased by the optimization of precursor combinations and thermal temperature. However, such pyrolysis methods usually limit the highly dispersed of Fe-N$_{4 }$sites due to the aggregation of Fe atoms. Recently, Zn-

based zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-8) [27,28], which has been used to encapsulate Fe-containing molecule guests (e.g., iron acetylacetonate or ferrocene), to prevent the formation of Fe nanoparticles, is an effective route to increase the density of Fe-N$_{4 }$sites. Despite these efforts, FeN-C catalysts derived from ZIF-8 still faces some significant challenges: (i) Excess Fe atoms could quickly form Fe nanoparticles when increasing the amount of iron precursor and would lead to a low density of Fe-N$_{4 }$ active sites (commonly below 1 wt%) [29]. (ii) The adsorption/ desorption behavior of oxygen-containing intermediates on Fe-N$_{4 }$sites must be optimized further to enhance the intrinsic activity [30 -33]. (iii) Fe-N-C catalysts derived from ZIF-8 mainly host micropore-dominant Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites [34], thus resulting in insufficient mass transport just through micropore channels [35,36]. (iv) Most of the Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites are embedded inside a carbon matrix, which led to low accessibility for the active sites [37 -39]. (V) The fast ORR activity degradation of Fe-N-C catalysts often occurs during the practical operation in PEMFCs and ZABs because of the corrosion of carbon support [40]. In response, increase the degree of graphitization in carbon support can resist corrosion [41,42]. When the pyrolysis temperature is above 900 ℃ , the graphitization of carbon support commenced and Fe-N$_{x }$sites formed [43]. But above 1000 ℃ , Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites would decompose and aggregate Fecontaining nanoparticles. Therefore, how to simultaneously construct densely exposed Fe-N$_{4 }$sites and suppress the serious erosion of carbon support for efficient and durable ORR is a great challenge, and the corresponding underlying mechanism is still unclear.

Fe-N$_{4 }$sites. This strategy not only tunes site-density, intrinsic activity, and accessibility of Fe-N$_{4 }$active sites but also promotes graphitization degree of carbon support in catalysts, thus boosting ORR activity and stability. The assembled ZAB exhibits a maximum peak power density of 217 mW cm GLYPH<0> 2 and a durable charge -discharge cycle for 1342 h. Moreover, the high output power in a PEMFC reaches 0.66 W cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$.

## 2. Experimental section

## 2.1. Synthesis of catalysts

In the first step, 3.941 g of 2-methylimidazole (2-MI) and 1.25 g of nano-SiO$_{2 }$were mixed in 90 mL of methanol under stirring (solution A). 3.596 g Zn(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O and 20 mg of iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)$_{3}$) were dissolved in 45 mL of methanol (solution B). Then B was added into A under stirring for 24 h at room temperature. The obtained product was washed for several times by methanol, finally dried at 60 · C under a vacuum environment. The obtained powder was heated to 1000 · C for 1 h (5 · C min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) under Ar atmosphere. The sample was treated with 4 M KOH etching for 6 h and 1 M HCl washing for 10 h. The dried sample was denoted as HP-Fe-N-C. Secondly, 50 mg of HP-Fe-N-C and 2 mg Fe (acac)$_{3 }$were mixed with 15 mL of ethanol by 1 h ultrasound and stirred at 50 · C. The obtained material was pyrolyzed at 900 · C for 1 h (Ar atmosphere). The obtained material was denoted as HP-Fe-N-C/2.

In this work, a SiO$_{2}$-mediated two-step pyrolysis strategy is reported to prepare Fe-N-C catalysts featuring densely exposed Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites on hierarchically porous carbon with a high graphitization degree. In this two-step pyrolysis route, the SiO$_{2}$-mediated pyrolysis in the first pyrolysis enables constructing the enlarged porosity with numerous hierarchical carbon structures and increasing the graphitization degree by high-temperature pyrolysis at 1000 ℃ . Meanwhile, the spatial confinement of ZIF-8 and SiO$_{2 }$ coating layer for acetylacetone iron is conducive to atomically dispersed Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites. During the second pyrolysis, the large surface area of porous carbon support with abundant spatial confinement anchoring sites promotes the production of dense

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Synthesis and physical characterization

The synthesis route for HP-Fe-N-C/2 is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, the Fe(acac)$_{3 }$(guest) was trapped in cavities of the ZIF-8 (host) during the nucleation of ZIF-8 [44]. Fe(acac)$_{3}$@ZIF-8@SiO$_{2 }$composite was formed by covering nano-SiO$_{2 }$(~15 nm) [45 -47]. During the assembly, the pore diameter and cavity diameter of the ZIF-8 is 3.4 Å and 11.6 Å, respectively, and the molecular diameter of Fe(acac)$_{3 }$is 9.7 Å [44]. According to the previous report [44], a Fe(acac)$_{3 }$molecule was easily encapsulated in a cage of ZIF-8. From the SEM images in Fig. S2 , a lot of nano-SiO$_{2 }$ is attached to the surface of ZIF-8 [35]. Powder XRD results reveal that the addition of nano-SiO$_{2 }$ did not affect the crystal structure of ZIF-8 ( Fig. S3 ). Then, Fe(acac)$_{3}$@ZIF-8@SiO$_{2 }$ was pyrolyzed at 1000 ℃ under Ar atmosphere, and the nano-SiO$_{2 }$layer enabled stable cover on the surface of the ZIF-8 after pyrolysis ( Fig. S4 ), thus preventing the migration and aggregation of Fe atoms because the spatial confinement effect of the ZIF-8 and nano-SiO$_{2 }$ layer could effectively separate the isolated Fe atoms. The nano-SiO$_{2 }$ and other impurities were removed by leaching in NaOH and HCl solution to obtain hierarchically porous Fe-N-C (denoted as HP-Fe-N-C). In the second step, Fe(acac)$_{3 }$and HP-Fe-N-C were mixed with ethanol by 1 h ultrasound and stirred at 60 ℃ . Thereinto, the HP-Fe-N-C catalyst possesses a highly porous structure with abundant anchor sites, which could efficiently anchor Fe(acac)$_{3 }$ molecules [48]. The dried sample was

heated to 900 ℃ for 1 h to obtain HP-Fe-N-C/2. The HP-Fe-N-C/2 catalyst was prepared by SiO$_{2}$-mediated secondary-atom-doping strategy. The synthesis of the Fe-N-C/2 was same as that of HP-Fe-N-C/2 without the addition of SiO$_{2 }$in the first step. The synthesis of the HPFe-N-C was same as that of HP-Fe-N-C/2 without the addition of Fe (acac)$_{3 }$in the second step.

Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM is usually carried out to observe the distribution of single Fe atoms in Fe-N-C catalysts. A lot of bright dots are observed on the carbon support (Fig. 2 a ~ b ). Furthermore, the diameter of some spots is measured to confirm that the distribution of

SEM image in Fig.S5 shows that Fe-N-C/2 possesses a typical ZIF-8 crystal morphology with a smooth surface and unobservable porous structure. Whereas HP-Fe-N-C (Fig. S6 a ) and HP-Fe-N-C/2 (Fig. S6 b ) exhibit a rough surface on the outline of the catalyst with porous structures. Moreover, the TEM image in Fig. 1 a reveals that Fe-N-C/2 obtained in the absence of nano-SiO$_{2 }$ is dense with none of the pore, while HP-Fe-N-C (Fig. 1 b ) and HP-Fe-N-C/2 (Fig. 1 c ) possess much more porous structure, suggesting the significant effect of nano-SiO$_{2 }$ in creating of such porous structure [49]. It is worth noting that it is not guaranteed that every ZIF-8 crystal has a uniform porous structure, resulting in some ZIF-8 crystals looking relatively smooth and some with obvious holes. Although not every crystal has uniform holes, our method results in the entire material having a porous structure. Therefore, our method regulates the pore size distribution of the catalyst, making the catalyst change from a single micropore structure to a microporemesoporous structure. As shown in Fig. 1 d, e, f , no Fe-containing nanoparticles are discovered in the HRTEM images of Fe-N-C/2, HPFe-N-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2. The SAED of Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HPFe-N-C/2 confirm the presence of carbon without any crystallized phases (inset in Fig. 1 d, e, f ). EDX mapping images (Fig. 1 g, Fig.S7 ) indicate that Fe and N are uniformly distributed over the framework in Fe-N-C/2 and HP-Fe-N-C/2.

the bright points in atomic size, as displayed in Fig. 2 c , the average diameter of some spots is 1.22 Å, suggesting that Fe atoms are dispersed in HP-Fe-N-C/2 as single-atom rather than nanoclusters, which is consistent with the previous work [40]. The coordination environment of Fe center is investigated by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The Fe K-edge XANES shows that the absorption energy of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is situated between that of Fe foil and Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$, suggesting that the valence state of Fe atoms in HP-Fe-N-C/2 is located between Fe$^{0 }$and Fe 3 + (Fig. 2 e ). The EXAFS of HP-Fe-N-C/2 only shows a peak located at about 1.5 Å, corresponding to Fe-N bond (Fig. 2 f ). No obvious Fe-Fe bond peak is observed at about 2.2 Å in HP-Fe-N-C/2, indicating that Fe species exists in HP-Fe-N-C/2 in the form of a single isolated atom. The EXAFS fitting curves in Fig. 2 g and fitting parameters in Table S1 indicate that one Fe atom is coordinated with four N atoms to construct the Fe-N$_{4 }$site in the HP-Fe-N-C/2. Wavelet transform (WT) of EXAFS is carried out to obtain more information on the coordination environment of Fe throughout the whole HP-Fe-N-C/2. As shown in Fig. 2 h -j , the Fe foil shows a maximum at about 7.7 Å GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which could be assigned to Fe-Fe scattering (Fig. 2 h ). Fe$_{2}$O$_{3 }$exhibits maximum at about 7.7 Å GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 3.4 Å GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, corresponding to Fe-Fe bond and Fe-O bond (Fig. 2 i ), respectively. For HP-Fe-N-C/2 (Fig. 2 j ), the maximum is only assigned to Fe-N bond. Therefore, according to above analysis, it could be concluded that Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites are atomically dispersed in HP-Fe-N-C/2.

N-C/2 is evaluated by N$_{2 }$adsorption -desorption (Fig. 3 a ~ c, Table S2 ). The HP-Fe-N-C and HP-Fe-N-C/2 show the characteristic type-IV isotherm (Fig. 3 a ), suggesting mesopores ' presence. HP-Fe-N-C/2 possesses a high surface area of 1530 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, higher than those of Fe-N-C/2 (1309 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) and HP-Fe-N-C (984 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$). This indicates that the SiO$_{2}$mediated two-step pyrolysis strategy effectively increases the surface area of the catalyst. Moreover, pore distributions (Fig. 3 b ~ c ) reveal that the main sharp peak for Fe-N-C/2 is below 4 nm. However, for HPFe-N-C and HP-Fe-N-C/2, an additional peak is observed from ~ 5 nm to ~ 20 nm, implying that abundant mesopores are formed due to the poreforming effect of the SiO$_{2}$-mediated method. In addition, many macropores in HP-Fe-N-C and HP-Fe-N-C/2 can be seen from the TEM images (Fig. 1 b ~ c ). Therefore, the high surface area and microporousmesoporous-macroporous structure of HP-Fe-N-C/2 can effectively expedite the mass/electron transport and promote the exposure of Fe-N$_{4 }$ active sites during the ORR process [50 -52].

XRD patterns for Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2 are shown in Fig. 3 d . The broad peaks are attributable to the (002) and (101) planes of carbon. No diffraction peaks related to the crystalline Fecontaining species are detected for Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HP-FeN-C/2. Raman spectra of Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2 exhibit two peaks at about 1350 and 1590 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, ascribed to the Dband and G-band, respectively (Fig. 3 e ). According to the previous report [53,54], the parameter R2 = D1 / (G + D1 + D2) is an indicator of the degree of the degree of graphitization in the catalysts [53,54]. It was

found the values of R2 for Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2 are 0.52, 0.51, and 0.49, respectively, which proves the similar graphitization degree in the synthesized catalyst. As shown in Fig. S8, the R2 value of the sample decreases with the increase of heat treatment temperature. This means increasing the graphitization degree by a higher heat treatment temperature in the first step is feasible [40]. However, increasing the degree of graphitization through higher temperatures (above1000 ℃ ) would cause the decomposition of Fe-N$_{x }$sites and the aggregation of Fe atoms [49,55]. Therefore, a reasonable heat treatment temperature is necessary for the rational design of Fe-N-C catalyst.

(Fig. 3 h ). The result of calculated N species content is summarized in Fig. 3 i . Specifically, the content ratio of pyridinic N, graphitic N, and FeN$_{x }$in HP-Fe-N-C/2 is higher than that in Fe-N-C/2 ( Table S4 ), which is expected to possess high ORR activity. The Fe 2p spectra of catalysts were analyzed in Fig. S9 . The peaks at 708.8 and 722.1 eV are attributed to Fe 2 + state and the peaks at 712.6 is attributed to Fe 3 + state. The peak at the binding energy of 708.8 eV is ascribed to Fe-N$_{x }$component [58]. The above results indicate that the Fe atoms are in the oxidative states and Fe-N$_{x }$sites are formed in the catalysts.

## 3.2. Electrocatalytic performances

The ORR activity of catalysts is scrutinized by CV and LSV tests in 0.1 mol/L KOH solution. Compared with Fe-N-C/2 and HP-Fe-N-C, the reduction peak of the CV curves ( Fig. S10 ) for the HP-Fe-N-C/2 shows the most positive potential and the highest peak current density. From the LSV curves (Fig. 4 a ), HP-Fe-N-C/2 delivers an impressive ORR activity with a half-wave potential ( E$_{1/2}$ ) of 0.918 V, much more positive than that of Fe-N-C/2 (0.880 V), HP-Fe-N-C (0.884 V), Pt/C (0.851 V), and recently published Pt-free catalysts ( Table S5 ). As depicted in Fig. 4 b , the kinetic current density ( j$_{k}$ ) of HP-Fe-N-C/2 reaches 54.4 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, 3.2 times higher than that of Fe-N-C/2 (17.1 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), 3.7 times higher than that of HP-Fe-N-C (14.6 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), and 9.9 times higher than that of Pt/C (5.5 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$). As shown in Fig. S11a , the E$_{1/2 }$ of

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to obtain the elemental information. XPS spectra confirm the presence of N, C, O, and Fe elements in Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2 (Fig. 3 f ). According to the statistics in Table S3 , the content of Fe (N) in Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2 is 0.4 (3.4), 0.3 (8.5), and 0.4 at% (3.4 at %). Obviously, the increase in Fe content of Fe-N-C/2 and HP-Fe-N-C/2 compares to that of HP-Fe-N-C. In addition, the Fe content in HP-Fe-N-C is 1.06 wt% from ICP-OES, lower than 2.01 wt% and 2.09 wt% for Fe-NC/2 and HP-Fe-N-C/2. This is attributed to the formation of abundant Fe-N$_{4 }$sites after anchoring Fe(acac)$_{3 }$molecules and then pyrolysis. The C1s spectra of Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2 is resolved into three peaks (Fig. 3 g ). The N1s spectra of Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and HPFe-N-C/2 are divided into five peaks, corresponding to pyridinic N, FeN$_{x}$, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N [56,57], respectively

catalyst is affected by different loadings [59], varying from 0.864 to 0.921 V (vs. RHE). When the loading on the GC surface is from 0.200 to 0.600 mg cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, both the half-wave potential and limiting current density change little, indicating that the catalytic activity reaches a relatively stable value. As shown in Fig. S11b , the gravimetric limiting current decreases by increasing the loading on the GC surface. When the loading on the GC surface is greater than 0.400 mg cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, the gravimetric limiting current tends to be stable. The Tafel slope for HP-Fe-N-C/ 2 is 64.07 mV dec$^{-1 }$(Fig. 4 c ), lower than that of Fe-N-C/2, HP-Fe-N-C, and Pt/C, suggesting that the porous structure of carbon framework accelerates the ORR kinetics and thus decreasing the Tafel slope.

LSV cures were tested at different rotation speeds (Fig. 4 d ), and inset is the corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots. The value of electron

transfer number (n) is calculated to be about 4.0. Moreover, Fig. 4 e reveals that HP-Fe-N-C/2 possesses a low H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$yield (0 ~ 2 %) and an electron transfer number of 3.97 ~ 3.99 at 0.2 ~ 1.0 V, which are superior to Pt/C (H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ yield: 2 ~ 8 %, n = 3.95 ~ 3.98). These results confirmed that a 4e$^{- }$ORR pathway for HP-Fe-N-C/2, which means it has high catalytic selectivity from O$_{2 }$ to H$_{2}$O and thus enhances ORR activity. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S12, the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ yield and electron transfer number of catalyst is affected by different loadings [60]. Take the data at 0.600 V as an example, when the loading is from 0.025 to 0.200 mg cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, the electron transfer number at 0.600 V increases by increasing the loading. When the loading is from 0.200 to 0.600 mg cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, the electron transfer number change little. In conclusion, no matter how the loading varies, the number of transferred electrons is

close to 4, indicating that the catalyst is an efficient 4-electron catalytic process.

The ORR durability of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is tested by an accelerated durability test (ADT). After 5000 cycles, only 9 mV of degradation in E$_{1/ }$ $_{2 }$for HP-Fe-N-C/2 (Fig. 4 g ). However, Pt/C shows a sharp shift with 23 mV in E$_{1/2 }$ (Fig. 4 h ). HP-Fe-N-C/2 possesses outstanding stability in alkaline medium, which superior to most of report catalysts ( Table S6 ). Furthermore, HP-Fe-N-C/2 exhibits excellent methanol resistance after adding methanol to the electrolyte (Fig. 4 i ).

The larger electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C$_{dl}$) represents higher electrochemical surface area [61,62]. As shown in Fig. S13 and Fig. 4 f , the C$_{dl }$of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is calculated to be 69.31 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, higher than that of HP-Fe-N-C (64.61 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$) and Fe-N-C/2 (58.68 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), further confirming the good mass transport for HP-Fe-N-C/2 during ORR due to its highly porous structures. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of catalysts are recorded in Fig. S14 . The differences in charge transfer resistance ( R$_{ct}$ ) value of Fe-N-C/2, HP-FeN-C, and HP-Fe-N-C/2 are minimal, indicating that the effect of charge transfer on the porous structure is negligible.

HP-Fe-N-C/2 also presents remarkable ORR performance in an acid medium. As shown in Fig. 5 a , the E$_{1/2 }$ of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is 0.792 V, comparable to that of Pt/C (0.830 V) and surpasses most of the reported catalysts ( Table S5 ). As shown in Fig. 5 b , HP-Fe-N-C/2 shows a j$_{k }$ of

24.21 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, comparable to that of Pt/C (29.99 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$). The excellent ORR activity of HP-Fe-N-C/2 in acid medium is also confirmed by a small Tafel plot slope of 78.97 mV dec$^{-1 }$(Fig. 5 c ). Moreover, HP-FeN-C/2 exhibits a 4e$^{- }$ORR process in acid medium (Fig. 5 d ).

ADT tests the ORR durability of HP-Fe-N-C/2 in an acid medium. The E$_{1/2 }$ experienced a slight decrease in HP-Fe-N-C/2 with 13 mV after 5000 cycles (Fig. 5 e ), lower than that of Pt/C (15 mV, Fig. 5 f ) and reveals high durability. For the measured HP-Fe-N-C/2 after ADT, no Fecontaining nanoparticles are observed in the TEM image ( Fig. S15 ) and XRD pattern ( Fig. S16 ), implying that Fe atoms remain atomically dispersed state after ADT in an acid medium. This indicates that HP-FeN-C/2 as an ORR catalyst is a promising candidate to replace Pt/C.

## 3.3. Theoretical calculation

DFT calculations were conducted to gain insight into the nature of the nitrogen dopant in the Fe-N-C catalyst. Compared to the Fe-N-C/2, the HP-Fe-N-C/2 catalyst possess higher pyridinic N and graphitic N content. Therefore, we constructed two configurations as shown in Fig. S17 . For HP-Fe-N-C/2, pyridinic N and graphitic N are embedded in the carbon matrix nearby the Fe-N$_{4 }$site. For Fe-N-C/2, the Fe-N$_{4 }$site is embedded in a carbon matrix without the pyridinic N and graphitic N dopants.

(h) Charging/discharging cycling curves obtained under different physical bending conditions at 2 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$(bending angles: 0 · , 90 · , 180 · , and 0 · ).

The charge density distribution was calculated in Fig. 6 a and b . The HP-Fe-N-C/2 exhibits increased electron density around the Fe atom than Fe-N-C/2. As shown in Table S7 , Fe atom in HP-Fe-N-C/2 is more positively charged than Fe-N-C/2. The highest occupied crystal orbital (HOCO) and the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) are calculated in Fig. S18 . The electron density of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is higher than Fe-N-C/ 2. This indicates that HP-Fe-N-C/2 possesses greater electron donor capacity than Fe-N-C/2 [63]. The HOCO and LUCO energy gap of HP-FeN-C/2 is 0.1859 eV, narrower than that of Fe-N-C/2 (0.4056 eV). These results confirm the regulated electronic structure of the HP-Fe-N-C/2, which is expected to alter the adsorption/desorption of ORR intermediates [63]. The density of state (DOS) curve (Fig. 6 c ) shows the dband center of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is GLYPH<0> 0.6563 eV, which is closer to the Fermi level ( E$_{f}$ ), compared with Fe-N-C/2 (-0.6996 eV, Fig. 6 d ). The d-band center close to the E$_{f }$ induces regulated binding strength of ORR intermediates. The DOS near the E$_{f }$ of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is higher than that of Fe-N-C/2, indicating that the doping of pyridinic N and graphitic N provides a more rapid electron transfer pathway.

respectively. The HP-Fe-N-C/2 possesses a smaller energy barrier than Fe-N-C/2, indicating that the introduced pyridinic N and graphitic N dopants in HP-Fe-N-C/2 are more likely to reduce the energy barrier and boost ORR. Figs. 6 g and Fig. S21 exhibit the possible ORR process for HP-Fe-N-C/2 and Fe-N-C/2. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the N dopants in Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites and the porous structure enhance the efficient ORR in HP-Fe-N-C/2 catalyst [64].

## 3.4. Zn-air battery performance

To explore the application of HP-Fe-N-C/2 as an air cathode, the liquid ZAB is assembled as displayed in Fig. 7 a . HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZAB exhibits an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.513 V (Fig. 7 b ), superior to that of Pt/C-based ZAB (1.422 V). As shown in Fig. 7 c , two seriesconnected HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZABs can successfully power a mobile phone (charging: 32 %) due to the high OCV, indicating the good working performance of HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZAB. The HP-Fe-N-C/2based ZAB exhibits a maximum peak power density of 217 mW cm GLYPH<0> 2 (Fig. 7 d ), significantly exceeding that of Pt/C (113 mW cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$). Fig. 7 e confirms that the HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZAB shows a specific capacity of 782 mAh g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, superior to that of Pt/C (714 mAh g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, this data is from our previous work [37]) and mainly reported Pt-free catalysts ( Table S8 ). As shown in Fig. 7 f , after discharge at various current

The optimized adsorption configurations of ORR intermediates on Fe-N-C/2 and HP-Fe-N-C/2 are presented in Figs. S19 and S20. Fig. 6 e and f shows the free energy diagram in an alkaline medium for the ORR pathway. The ORR rate-determining step of Fe-N-C/2 and HP-Fe-N-C/2 is OH* → OH -, and corresponding energy barrier is 1.13 eV and 0.83 eV,

density of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 5 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZAB can keep a discharge voltage platform of 1.35, 1.32, 1.28, 1.18 and 1.34 V, respectively, higher than those of Pt/C-based ZAB (1.32, 1.28, 1.22, 1.10 and 1.29 V), implying the excellent rate capability of HP-Fe-N-C/2based ZAB. The excellent voltage recoverability and rate performance of the HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZAB are likely due to the 3D interconnected porous structure of HP-Fe-N-C/2, which reduces the resistance to mass transfer and boosts the fast ORR kinetics.

durable Zn-air battery under practical conditions.

## 3.5. All-solid-state flexible Zn-air battery performance

For the applications to wearable energy devices, we further assemble the all-solid-state flexible ZAB (AF-ZAB) as shown in Fig. 8 a . The prepared solid-state electrolyte shows excellent mechanical flexibility with tensile (Fig. 8 b ) and bending ( Fig. S24 ) state. The HP-Fe-N-C/2-based AF-ZAB exhibits a stable OCV of up to 1.476 V (Fig. 8 c ), higher than that of Pt/C-based AF-ZAB (1.401 V). As shown in Fig. 8 d , HP-Fe-N-C/2based AF-ZAB could keep running for 13.5 h at 2 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, outperforming that of Pt/C-based AF-ZAB (7.3 h). The peak power density of HP-Fe-N-C/2-based AF-ZAB is 116 mW cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$(Fig. 8 e ), superior to that of Pt/C-based AF-ZAB (100 mW cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$). Two AF-ZAB can power a series of red LEDs (Fig. 8 f ). One AF-ZAB can power a fan (Fig. 8 g ). Furthermore, the charge -discharge performance of HP-Fe-N-C/2-based AF-ZAB is tested at various bending angles in Fig. 8 h . The charge -discharge performance of HP-Fe-N-C/2-based AF-ZAB is not affected at different bending angles (0, 90, 180, and 0 · ). Therefore, the excellent flexibility and stability of HP-Fe-N-C/2-based AF-ZAB demonstrate the potential application in flexible and wearable energy conversion.

Considering the superior ORR activity and stability of HP-Fe-N-C/2 in acid media, the HP-Fe-N-C/2 is assembled in the cathode of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in PEMFCs (Fig. 9 a ). As expected, as shown in Fig. 9 b , the HP-Fe-N-C/2-based PEMFC exhibits an OCV of 0.907 V and a peak power density of 0.66 W cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, which comparable to those of Pt/C (0.972 V, 1.05 W cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$). The HP-Fe-N-C/2 cathode

More importantly, the long-term cycle stability of charge -discharge is a technical barrier for Pt-free catalysts in ZABs. To further evaluate the performance of rechargeable ZABs, we firstly measure the OER activity. As displayed in Fig. S22a , the potential at 10 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$of HP-Fe-N-C/2 is 1.655 V ( E$_{j}$ = 10 = 1.655 V), which is similar to that of RuO$_{2 }$ ( E$_{10 }$ = 1.657 V). Moreover, as shown in Fig. S22b , HP-Fe-N-C/2 shows a Δ E ( Δ E = E$_{j}$ = 10 -E$_{1/2}$ ) value of 0.737 V, comparable to that of Pt/C + RuO$_{2 }$ (0.806 V). Therefore, the excellent ORR/OER activity of HP-Fe-N-C/2 inspires us to test ZAB ' s long-term charge -discharge performance further. Remarkably, as shown in Fig. 7 g , HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZAB exhibits a negligible voltage gap of charge discharge after operating for 1342 h (8052 cycles), which is comparable to most catalysts ( Table S9 ), suggesting its long-life charge -discharge performance. In addition, we further confirm the long-time application of HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZAB in the actual devices. As performed in the inset of Fig. 7 g, a HP-Fe-N-C/2based ZAB could power a timer for 68 min by many times. Two connected HP-Fe-N-C/2-based ZABs also could light a series of LEDs for more than 30 days ( Fig. S23 ). The above results demonstrate that HPFe-N-C/2 catalyst is a potential air cathode for an efficient and

impressively generated a current density of 0.72 A cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$at 0.6 V, which is superior to Pt/C cathode (0.51 A cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$at 0.6 V) under the identical testing condition. The encouraging performance of HP-Fe-N-C/2 as ORR catalyst in PEMFCs indicates its highly promising application.

In the practical application of PEMFCs and ZABs, excellent mass transfer at the three-phase interface is particularly important. As shown in Fig. 9 c , HP-Fe-N-C/2 possesses a porous structure with superior threephase interface for fast accessibility of the electrolyte and O$_{2 }$ to Fe-N$_{4 }$ active sites, which achieves an ultra-high utilization of active sites [65]. The high specific area and mesoporous-macroporous in HP-Fe-N-C/2 could efficiently shorten the diffusion distance, and the abundant FeN$_{4 }$sites could reduce the thickness of the diffusion layer, which facilitates the transfer of O$_{2}$. As illustrated in Fig. 9 d , compare to Fe-N-C/2, the fast ORR catalysis is ascribed to the densely accessible Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites and the more three-phase-interfaces mass transport in the HP-Fe-N-C/2.

## 4. Conclusion

In summary, a SiO$_{2}$-mediated two-step pyrolysis strategy was proposed to construct densely exposed Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites on porous graphitized carbon. The SiO$_{2}$-assisted high-temperature pyrolysis in the first pyrolysis enables the construction of the enlarged porosity, increases the graphitization degree, and promotes the formation of atomically dispersed Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites by the spatial confinement of ZIF-8 and SiO$_{2 }$ coating layer. The subsequent adsorption and pyrolysis process further promote the creation of abundant Fe-N$_{4 }$active sites. Due to the synergistically advantageous features of densely exposed Fe-N$_{4 }$ sites, enhanced intrinsic activity of Fe-N$_{4 }$sites by pyridinic N and graphitic N dopants, and highly graphitized carbon matrix, the HP-Fe-N-C/2 exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both alkaline and acidic media. The assembled ZAB displays a high peak power density of 217 mW cm GLYPH<0> 2 and long-life cycling stability for 1342 h. Moreover, the maximum output power in a PEMFC reaches 0.66 W cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. This work paves a new route to rationally design efficient and durable ORR catalysts for ZABs and PEMFCs.
