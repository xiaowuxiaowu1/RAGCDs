## ABSTRACT

Carbon dots (CDs) as a novel and green nanomaterial exhibit a promising application in enhancing the chloride binding capacity of cement to extend the service life of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. However, their size influence on the enhancement of chloride binding is still a research gap, enormously hindering the further employment of CDs toward cement system. Herein, their size-induced effect on chloride binding actions of cement is comprehensively unveiled using CDs with various sizes for the first time. Specifically, three kinds of CDs with different sizes are controllably prepared through simply altering the calcinating time of citric acid. And the relationship between sizes of CDs and chloride binding capacity of cement is confirmed through the equilibrium tests. More importantly, the mechanism for the effect of CDs sizes on chloride binding is reasonably proposed according to the alteration analyses of phase compositions. The consequences demonstrate that the chloride binding capacity in cement modified by CDs with average sizes of 1.73, 5.79, and 12.37 nm increases by 41%, 20%, and 14% respectively, compared with that of the blank group after 28-d immersion in 3 mol/L NaCl solution. This testifies that the chloride binding capacity of CDs-incorporated cement is negatively correlative with CDs sizes. The related mechanism is that CDs with smaller sizes can provide more nucleation sites to promote cement hydration, further advancing the production of C -S -H gels and monosulfate (Ms), thus more markedly enhancing the physical adsorption and chemical binding of chloride ions in cement pastes. This work would guide the preparation of CDs with more suitable sizes to improve the chloride binding ability of cement, thus anticipated to extend the service life of RC structures in coastal environment, ultimately reducing the CO$_{2 }$ emission from cement industry.

## 1. Introduction

Cement-based materials serve as the most extensive used construction materials in the world, and their demand increases dramatically as urbanization accelerates [1,2]. However, cement industry is regarded as an intensive source of CO$_{2 }$ emission, and the cement production is responsible for 6.5% of global CO$_{2 }$emission [3]. To overcome the issue, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using green cement production technology [4]; 2) developing the low-carbon cement [5]; 3) prolonging the lifespan of reinforced concrete (RC) structures [6]. Among them, the extension of the service life for RC structures have attracted extensive attention, since it enormously reduces not only the employment of cement, but also construction waste and carbon emissions from

demolition. Unfortunately, RC structures are inevitably susceptible to deterioration especially in coastal area and regions subjected to deicing salt application, greatly shortening their service life. It is well-known that the invasion of chloride ions is the principal factor contributing to the deterioration of reinforcement [7,8].

Chloride binding technique is considered as one of the most costefficient methods to alleviate the corrosion issue caused by chloride ions [9]. By transforming the freely chloride into immobilized counterparts, chloride binding technique effectively decreases the concentration of free chloride ions, thereby enhancing the durability of RC structures [10]. This has been proved that the chloride binding technique in cement composites is divided into two categories [11]: One is physical adsorption mainly induced through calcium silicate hydrate

(C -S -H) gels; The other is chemical binding mainly achieved by monosulfate (Ms). Physical adsorption is primarily attributed to the van der Waals attraction and electrostatic forces between chloride ions and C -S -H gels. And chemical binding predominantly occurs through the reaction between chloride ions and Ms to generate Friedel ' s salt (Fs) [12]. Up to now, nanomaterials, supplementary cementitious materials and mineral admixtures have been used to boost anti-chloride-corrosion ability of cement composites [7,13,14].

Despite considerable progress, CDs application of chloride binding technique in cement paste is still in an early stage. There are multitudes of crucial barriers yet to be surmounted. Among them, the size-induced effect of CDs on chloride binding performance in cement is a primary challenge. This can be attributed to two reasons. (1) The sizes of CDs are easily affected by the preparation method, raw materials, and other factors, resulting in a wide range of size variations [31 -33]. For instance, Hu ' s group found that CDs with average sizes of 3, 8, and 13 nm were synthesized by altering the pulse width [31]. (2) The sizes of CDs have a significant impact on their characteristics [34 -37]. For example, Erogbogbo ' s group found that CDs with a larger size showed weaker photoluminescence emission [36]; And Leblanc ' s team revealed that the sizes of CDs demonstrated a significant effect on photocatalytic activity [34]; In addition, Zhao, Chen, et al., stated that the smaller the sizes of CDs, the higher their corrosion inhibiting behaviors [35,37]. To sum up, the sizes of CDs present a significant influence on their optical properties, photocatalysis, and inhibition actions. As a result, it is reasonable to infer that the sizes of CDs can affect their enhancing effect on chloride binding abilities of cement composites. However, the size-induced influence of CDs on enhancement of chloride binding is still a research gap. To prepare more suitable sizes of CDs for further enhancing the chloride binding, it is highly urgent to investigate their size-induced influence on chloride binding capacity of cement adopting CDs with different sizes.

Benefiting from their less dosage, large specific surface area and high reactivity, nanomaterials have become a research hotspot. Until now, nano Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$, layered double hydroxides, and carbon nanotubes have been substantiated to effectively enhance chloride binding capacity of cement composites [15 -17]. However, these nanomaterials are subject to poor dispersity and high cost [18 -20], restricting their large-scale application in practical engineering. Fortunately, carbon dots (CDs), as a novel zero-dimensional carbon-based nanomaterial, possess not only distinguished dispersity and low cost, but also benign environmental friendliness, high chemical stability, easily available precursors, tunable surface groups and ultrasmall size, thus attracting intensive attention [21 -26]. For instance, Qu et al. firstly utilized CDs to improve the compressive strength of cement-based composites, and revealed the relevant mechanism [27]. Recently, Li ' s group reported that CDs could endow foams of foam concrete with higher density, viscosity and stability [28]. More importantly, our latest studies evidenced that CDs owned an excellent dispersion stability in saturated Ca(OH)$_{2 }$ solution, and could significantly augment the chloride binding capacity of cement [29,30]. In detail, the deliberately designed CDs, with rich oxygen-containing surface functional groups and a highly crystalline graphene structure, led to a substantial enhancement of 109% in chloride binding content compared to the blank group [29]. Furthermore, N-doped CDs resulted in a significant improvement of 134% in the content of chloride binding for cement pastes [30]. Hence, CDs have demonstrated an enormous potential for boosting the chloride binding behaviors of cement.

This work controllably synthesizes green CDs with three kinds of sizes, comprehensively investigates their effect on chloride binding ability of cement, and deeply discloses the underlying mechanism. In detail, CDs with diverse sizes are successfully synthesized through simply changing the calcination time of citric acid (the only precursor). The relationship between sizes of CDs and content of chloride binding for CDs-modified cement pastes is determined by the equilibrium tests. And the related mechanism is reasonably proposed through the

investigation of cement phase alteration by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM). This work provides a guidance for enormously enhancing the capacity of cement to bind free chloride ions using green CDs with a suitable size. This not only would contribute to promoting the engineering application of CDs, but also be forecasted to extend the lifespan of RC structures, finally reducing the CO$_{2 }$emission from cement industry.

## 2. Experimental section

## 2.1. Materials

The citric acid and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and used without further treatment. The entire experiment was conducted with deionized (DI) water, and the cement used in this study was Portland cement (PC) PI 52.5 R. The detailed properties and compositions of PC were listed in Table 1 and Table 2.

## 2.2. Synthesis of CDs

CDs with different sizes were prepared by pyrolysis treatment using citric acid as the only precursor. In detail, 15 g citric acid was placed in each alumina crucible, and then calcinated for 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 h respectively at a temperature of 200 · C. Following the process of cooling to ambient conditions, the as-prepared products were dissolved in DI water. Then the mixture was neutralized by NaOH, and underwent centrifugation at a speed of 10 000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant underwent filtration using a 0.2 μ m membrane, followed by dialysis to eliminate insoluble products, sodium salt and large particles. Ultimately, the CDs with different sizes were obtained through rotary evaporation and freeze-drying, and then named as 0.5 H CDs, 1.0 H CDs, and 2.0 H CDs respectively according to their calcinating time.

## 2.3. Mixture proportions and preparation method

To detect the modification effect of CDs sizes on chloride binding behavior, four kinds of paste specimens without/with diverse CDs sizes were prepared and named as C, 0.5 H, 1.0 H, and 2.0 H. To obtain an obvious improvement of chloride binding content in cement, the CDs dosage was confirmed as 0.2 wt% (by the weight of cement) based on the previous research [30]. All specimens share a common water-to-cement ratio of 0.5. The detailed mixture proportions of all groups were shown in Table 3. During the preparation of pastes specimens, the CDs with different sizes were dissolved in DI water irrespectively. Then the mixing solution was added into cement. Subsequently, the obtained mixture was stirred using a mixer. The obtained cement paste was cast into 20 mm × 20 mm × 20 mm silastic mould, and protected by a plastic film to diminish moisture loss. The specimens were demolded after 1-d curing, and placed in a curing chamber at 20 · C and relative humidity of > 95% for 28-d curing.

with FEI Talos F200S transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Brucker MFP-3D infinity atomic force microscopy (AFM). Thermo scientific DXR Raman spectra were utilized to record the structure information of all the CDs. Furthermore, the functional groups and element compositions of various CDs were measured via Thermo Scientific Nicolet-6700 FTIR spectra in the range of 600 -3600 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS).

## 2.5. Chloride binding capacity and calculation

The chloride binding performance of cement pastes was evaluated through the typical equilibrium test [38]. The cement pastes after 28-d curing were vacuum-dried at 60 · C until their weight stabilized, and subsequently pulverized into a uniform powder smaller than 75 μ m in size through the ball grinding mill. Subsequently, as-obtained powder of 4 g was added to 40 mL 3 mol/L NaCl solution. Then, the mixture was violently shacked to guarantee the full contact between powder and solution. To avoid evaporation and carbonation, the mixture was stored in the sealed plastic centrifuge tube at the temperature of 25 · C. The maximum immersion time of all the cement pastes was 28 d for the measurement of the chloride binding content. After immersion of 1, 7, 14, and 28 d, the supernatant was separated from the mixture by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Finally, the concentration of remanent chloride ions in the liquid supernatant was determined according to the Chinese standard JGJT 322 -2013, utilizing silver nitrate (0.1 mol/L) solution and an automatic potentiometric titrator. To ensure statistical reliability, each specimen was tested eight times. The content of chloride binding ( C$_{b}$ ) was calculated through Eq. 1 :

where C$_{b}$ , V$_{0}$ , C$_{0}$ , C$_{f }$ and W represented the content of chloride binding (mg/g paste), NaCl solution volume (mL), the initial concentration of chloride ions in NaCl solution (mol/L), the measured concentration of chloride ions in NaCl solution (mol/L), and the mass of specimen powder (g), respectively.

The content of Friedel ' s salt (Fs) in paste specimens was calculated through Eq. 2, presuming the mass loss of Fs investigated by DTG related to the removal of six molecules water from the main layer structures of Fs [7], and the content of chloride binding ( C Fs b ) arising from Fs was confirmed based on Eq. 3:

The factor of 20 in Eq. 3 is a coefficient, originating from the molarity of chloride ions in Fs (Ca$_{4}$Al$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$(OH)$_{12}$ . 4 H$_{2}$O or C$_{3}$A $^{.}$CaCl$_{2}$$^{.}$10 H$_{2}$ O; 2 mol chloride/mol Fs) and the unit conversion from " m$_{Fs}$ " (wt%) to

" C Fs b " (mg/g). Where M Fs (561 g/mol) represented the molar mass of Fs; m H represented the mass loss associated with the removal of six molecules water from the main layer structures of Fs (wt%); M H (18 g/mol) and M Cl (35 g/mol) represented the molar mass of water andchloride element respectively.

## 2.6. Phase compositions of diverse specimens

To reveal the influence mechanism of CDs sizes on chloride binding, the phase compositions in different cement pastes prior to and following 14-d immersion were investigated through XRD, DTG and SEM. To obtain the testing samples, the cement paste was extracted from NaCl solution, washed twice with DI water to reduce the residual NaCl solution, and vacuum-dried at 60 · C until a constant mass. XRD were analyzed utilizing a D8 diffractometer manufactured by Brucker. It was equipped with a Cu K α radiation source, operated at 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current with a scanning speed of 6 · /min. DTG analyses were conducted in a flowing N$_{2 }$atmosphere. The temperature range spanned from 20 to 1000 · C with a heating rate of 10 · C/min. SEM test was captured using a MIRA LMS instrument manufactured by TESCAN.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Characteristics of CDs

TEM images and size distributions of various CDs are shown in Fig. 1. Apparently, all the CDs present quasi-spherical shapes, and share high dispersity without aggregation (Fig. 1a-c). This well coincides with the finding of the previous references [30,35,39,40]. The high dispersity of CDs lays a solid foundation for their application in cement-based materials. Through randomly measuring more than 150 particles, size distributions of diverse CDs are illustrated in Fig. 1d-f. Specifically, 0.5 H CDs have a size distribution of 8.2 -16.2 nm, and an approximate average size of 12.37 nm. When the calcination time reaches 1 h, 1.0 H CDs possess an average size of 5.79 nm with a size distribution ranging from 2.0 to 10.0 nm. With the further increase of calcination time, 2.0 H CDs show a smaller size distribution between 1.0 and 2.6 nm, with an approximate average size of 1.73 nm.

FTIR, XPS and Raman spectra are adopted to reveal functional groups, chemical compositions, and structures of CDs. As exhibited in FTIR spectra (Fig. 3a), three types of CDs hold identical adsorption peaks, demonstrating that the calcination time fails to influence the categories of surface groups. Thus, there is no difference in the type of functional groups on CDs surface. Specifically, the peak at 1505 -1648 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$corresponds to the stretching vibration of C -C bonds, disclosing that all the CDs hold the sp$^{2 }$C structure [41]. And the peaks at 1270, 1380, and 3415 cm GLYPH<0> 1 correspond to C GLYPH<0> OH, COO ¡ , and GLYPH<0> OH

AFM images further characterize the dispersity and topographical height distributions of various CDs. As displayed in Fig. 2a-c, all the CDs exhibit high dispersity, consistent with the observation of TEM. According to results of Fig. 2d-f, the topographical height of 0.5 H CDs mainly distributes ranging from 6.0 to 8.5 nm. As the calcination time extending to 1.0 h, the height distribution of 1.0 H CDs falls in the range of 2.3 -2.5 nm. The topographical height of 1.0 H CDs decreases significantly compared with that of 0.5 H CDs. With the calcination time continuing to prolong, 2.0 H CDs possess the smallest topographical height of approximately 1.4 -2.4 nm. In brief, both TEM and AFM images manifest that the as-prepared CDs share excellent dispersity, and their sizes decrease gradually with increasing calcination time.

respectively [42 -45]. These abundant oxygen-containing groups not only endow CDs with high dispersity [46], but also contribute to accelerating the cement hydration [47]. As illustrated in full range XPS spectra (Fig. 3b), all the as-prepared CDs contain the same elements of C, O and Na. It is worth mentioning that Na element as the residue originates from NaOH (used for neutralization) instead of CDs. The high-resolution C1s (Fig. 3d-f) and O1s (Fig. 3g-i) spectra are executed to investigate the exhaustive information of surface groups. In all the high-resolution C1s spectra, three peaks are assigned to C -C/C -C, C -O

and C -O [48]. The C -C/C -C bonds are the main component (more than 61.5%), further suggesting that these CDs mainly consist of a large number sp$^{2 }$C structures. In high-resolution O1s spectra, three peaks are attributed to C -O, C -O and Na KLL, respectively [49]. As illustrated in Table 4, for three kinds of CDs, they share a similar proportion of C and O elements, and their surface groups do not exhibit significantly different content ratio. This suggests that the change of calcination time remarkably affects the sizes of CDs, but marginally influences their chemical composition and surface groups. Moreover, as illustrated in

| 0.5 H | 56.74%   | 43.26%   | 61.46%        | 32.16%  | 6.38%   |
| 1.0   | 59.97%   | 40.03%   | 66.10%        | 29.57%  | 4.33%   |
| 2.0 H | 66.93%   | 33.07%   | 71.57%        | 24.04%  | 4.39%   |

Fig. 3c, all the CDs exhibit two distinct peaks in Raman spectra. D band (1361 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) and G band (1565 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) correspond to the disordered sp3 defects and sp$^{2 }$carbon, respectively. The intensity ratios of these two characteristic bands ( I$_{D}$ / I$_{G}$ ) from 0.5 H CDs, 1.0 H CDs, and 2.0 H CDs are less than 1.0, which are 0.82, 0.92, and 0.98 respectively. This implies that all the as-prepared CDs share favorable crystallinity.

To summarize, three kinds of CDs with different sizes are controllably synthesized through simply changing the calcinating time of the precursor (citric acid). These as-prepared CDs possess markedly different sizes, while share identical surface functional groups, similar chemical compositions, and crystallinity. This establishes a foundational basis for investigate the size-induced effect on the chloride binding in cement modified with CDs.

## 3.2. Chloride binding capacity of diverse specimens

To reveal the size-caused effect of CDs on chloride binding, the content of chloride binding ( C$_{b}$ ) values in various pastes specimens at diverse exposure times in NaCl solution are measured utilizing the modified typical equilibrium test. As shown in Fig. 4a, C$_{b }$ values from the specimens with or without CDs significantly improve as the prolongation of exposure time. In comparison with the blank group (namely, C group), chloride binding behaviors of CDs-modified specimens evidently enhance regardless of exposure time. And with the reduction of CDs sizes, the chloride binding ability of paste specimens gradually promote. Specifically, 2.0 H group containing CDs of the smallest size possesses the largest C$_{b }$ value of 30.4 mg/g after 28-d exposure, following by 1.0 H group (25.7 mg/g) and 0.5 H group (24.6 mg/ g), improving by 41%, 19% and 14% than C group respectively. It should be pointed out that the CDs-caused increase rates of C$_{b }$ value undergo an obvious change (Fig. 4b). In detail, for one thing, the increase rate increases gradually with the reduction of CDs sizes irrespective of immersion time, indicating that CDs with smaller sizes can confer the stronger chloride binding behaviors on cement pastes. For another thing, all the specimens reveal the highest increase rate at 1-d immersion stage. And their increase rate reduces gradually with the prolongation of exposure time. For instance, the increase rates of 2.0 H group are 185%,

Construction and Building Materials 425 (2024) 136103 Shan et al.

76%, 52% and 41% after 1-, 7-, 14- and 28-d immersion separately, indicating that the as-prepared CDs endow cement pastes with capacity to quickly immobilize free chloride ions. These findings above demonstrate that all the CDs with different sizes demonstrate an efficient enhancement in the chloride binding capacity of cement; And CDs with smaller sizes exhibit a more effective enhancement. In other words, the CDs-induced promotion on chloride binding is negatively correlative with their sizes ranging from 1.73 to 12.37 nm.

## 3.3. Compositions analysis of diverse paste specimens

To obtain a deeper understanding of how the sizes of CDs affect the capacity of chloride binding in cement paste, XRD, DTG and SEM are executed to systematically explore the alteration of phase composition in different paste specimens prior to and following 14-d immersion in NaCl solution. As displayed in Fig. 5a, all the paste specimens possess similar characteristic peaks (including 18.1 · and 29.4 · ascribed to Ca (OH)$_{2 }$(PDF: ICSD 98 -007 -3467) and CaCO$_{3 }$(PDF: ICSD 98 -015 -8257) respectively) [50] before immersion. This illustrates that the

XRD test of various paste specimens: (a) prior to and (b) following 14-d exposure to the NaCl solution; Phase compositions of different cement paste calculated by Rietveld method (c) prior to and (d) subsequent to 14-d immersion in the NaCl solution. (Cc: CaCO$_{3}$; CH: Ca(OH)$_{2}$; Fs: Friedel ' s salt).

Construction and Building Materials 425 (2024) 136103 Shan et al.

incorporation of CDs fails to alter the hydrate composition. It should be noted that CaCO$_{3 }$originates from the unavoidable carbonization reaction between Ca(OH)$_{2 }$and CO$_{2}$. Since amorphous C -S -H gels cannot be observed by XRD patterns, Rietveld method is employed for a quantitatively analysis of their content in various specimens. The non-crystal phases are considered as C -S -H gels, calculated as 100% minus the content of crystal phases [51]. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, compared to that of the blank group (61.04%), the proportion of C -S -H gels in modified paste specimens with CDs increases from 62.60% to 68.58%. And C -S -H content represents a significant increasing trend as the sizes of CDs decrease. Specifically, 2.0 H group with CDs of the smallest size shows the highest C -S -H gels content of 68.58%, following by 1.0 H group (67.25%), and 0.5 H group (62.60%). Correspondingly, the content of unhydrated phase (C$_{3}$S/C$_{2}$S) gradually decreases (from 11.25% for C group to 6.87% for 2.0 H group) with the reduction of CDs sizes. These findings reflect that CDs are expected to advance cement hydration; And the smaller the sizes of CDs, the stronger the hydration promotion. Since C -S -H gels are predominantly accountable for physically adsorbing chloride ions via Vander Waals forces or electrostatic attraction, the introduction of CDs strengthens the physical adsorption of free chloride ions, and smaller-sized CDs are beneficial to achieving higher physical adsorption in cement pastes. As displayed in Fig. 5b, a new peak at 11 · ascribed to Fs (PDF: ICSD 98 -008 -8617) [52] is found in all the pastes specimens after 14-d immersion in the NaCl solution. It certifies that the chloride chemical binding through the reaction between Ms and free chloride ions is carried out [53]. Generally, the intensity of the Fs peak is positively correlative to its content. Obviously, all the specimens containing CDs exhibit stronger intensities of Fs peak than the blank group; And the smaller the CDs sizes, the higher the Fs peak. The result of Rietveld refinement further substantiates the discovery above, the content of Fs increases from 8.1% of C specimen to 9.3% of 0.2 H specimen (Fig. 5d). It means that CDs are able to promote the generation of Ms, thus enhancing the chemical binding of chloride ions in cement pastes. Meanwhile, Ms-induced chemical binding of chloride ions enhances as CDs sizes decrease.

In addition to XRD test, DTG is adopted to obtain more specifical information regarding the phase compositions of various specimens. As shown in DTG curves (Fig. 6a), the weight loss peaks within the range of 90 -125 · C, 420 -480 · C and 550 -810 · C from all the specimens are attributed to the decomposition of C -S -H gels/Ettringite (AFt), Ca(OH)$_{2 }$ and CaCO$_{3 }$ respectively [54 -56]. Since the previous studies have evidenced that C -S -H gels are dominant in the mass of cement hydration products [57], the change of C -S -H/AFt peak can be regarded as the change of C -S -H content. Clearly, as the reduction of CDs sizes, the content of C -S -H gels increases. And 2.0 H group containing the smallest-sized CDs has the strongest mass loss peak of C -S -H gels. The result firmly confirms that CDs with smaller size contribute to advancing the cement hydration to produce more C -S -H, thus enormously enhancing the physically adsorptive capacity of chloride ions in cement.

The proportion of physical adsorption and chemical binding is conducive to better understanding the CDs-caused enhancement mechanism of chloride binding in cement pastes. According to the fact that the chemical binding and physical adsorption are dominated by Ms and C -S -H gels respectively, the influence of other phases such as Ca(OH)$_{2 }$ and C$_{3}$A on chloride binding is considered to be negligible. To calculate the proportion, the chemical binding ( C Fs b ) by Fs is firstly confirmed using Eq. 3. And then the physical adsorption ( C CSH b ) associated with C -S -H is calculated through Equation 4 : C CSH b = C$_{b}$ -C Fs b . The proportion of physical adsorption and chemical binding after 14-d immersion in NaCl solution is exhibited in Fig. 6b . Both physically adsorptive and chemically binding behaviors significantly enhance with the incorporation of CDs, and the chemical binding accounts for a larger proportion. This finding well coincides with the result of our previous report [29]. With the reduction of CDs sizes, the bound chloride contents of physical adsorption and chemical binding gradually increase. Specifically, 2.0 H group owns the highest C Fs b of 21.27 mg/g and C CSH b of 6.76 mg/g, increasing by 41.8% and 132.0% separately than C group. This evidences that CDs with the smallest size confer the strongest chloride binding capacity on cement matrices, owing to more production of C -S -H and Ms.

Furthermore, the mass loss peaks within the range of 130 -190 · C and 260 -360 · C are ascribed to the disintegration of Ms and Fs separately [58,59]. Compared to the C group, CDs-modified groups exhibit higher contents of Ms and Fs which increase as the sizes of CDs decrease. This reflects that the smaller sizes of CDs can generate more Ms to react with free chloride ions, thus improving the chemical binding of chloride ions in cement pastes. All the observations of DTG coincidence with the results from XRD analyses.

The morphologies of various specimens before and after 14-d immersion are investigated through SEM test (Fig. 7). As presented in Fig. 7a-d, the amorphous C -S -H are the dominated phase. This is consistent with the previous result that C -S -H gels occupy more than 70% of total volume in cement hydration products [60]. With respect to the specimen without CDs (Fig. 7a), C -S -H gels own a haphazard distribution, and attach to unhydrated phases and hydration products such as Ca(OH)$_{2}$; Meanwhile, the surfaces of a large number of unhydrated phases (C$_{2}$S/C$_{3}$S) seem to be smooth, indicating the production of C -S -H gels is insufficient, thereby failing to largely cover the unhydrated crystal. Regarding the CDs-modified specimens (Fig. 7b-d), the content of C -S -H gels gradually increases as the decrease of CDs sizes. And the specimen with the smallest-sized CDs represents the highest C -S -H content. This corroborates that CDs can accelerate the hydration of cement, and advance the formation of C -S -H gels; Meanwhile, their promotion effect is negatively correlative to the sizes of CDs. After 14-d immersion, a new phase characterized by hexagonal flaky crystals ranging in size from 1 to 3 μ m belongs to Fs. With respect to C group (Fig. 7e), a small amount of Fs scattered throughout the cement paste. Referring to specimens with

CDs modification (Fig. 7f-h), the content of Fs further increases with the reduction of CDs sizes. Meanwhile, the content change tendency of C -S -H gels and Fs is well corresponding to the results of XRD and TG test. In conclusion, smaller particle sizes of CDs are more efficient to promote the hydration of cement paste, facilitating the generation of C -S -H and Fs, thus enhancing both physical adsorption and chemical bonding.

To sum up, the investigation of XRD, DTG, and SEM from diverse specimens prior to and following 14-d immersion demonstrate that CDs with various sizes ranging from 1.73 to 12.37 nm are able to advance the cement hydration to produce more C -S -H gels and Ms, thus enhancing the physical adsorption and chemical binding of chloride ions. Crucially, the relationship between sizes of CDs and phase compositions of cement is disclosed. That is CDs with smaller sizes tend to accelerate cement hydration more strongly, thereby more remarkably enhancing chloride binding of cement system.

## 3.4. Influence mechanism of CDs sizes on chloride binding

According to the systematic analyses above, the effect mechanism of CDs sizes on chloride binding in cement is reasonably proposed (Fig. 8). Namely, CDs with smaller sizes can more significantly stimulate the production of C -S -H gels and Ms by their nucleation effect, thus greatly promoting the physical adsorption and chemical binding of cement pastes. On the one hand, according to the previous nucleation mechanism [61], the nucleation effect of CDs can be ascribed to the fact that the hydration products preferentially attach to CDs surface [30], since the nucleation energy on CDs surface is smaller than that in pore solution of cement. This facilitates the crystallization of hydrates. Therefore, CDs can significantly accelerate the hydration of cement. On the other hand, CDs with larger sizes possess a smaller quantity of particles under

the same dosage, consequently causing a decrease of nucleation sites. Meanwhile, the previous studies have disclosed that the specific surface area is negatively correlative to the particle diameter [62], and the nucleation sites of hydration products increase with the specific surface area of CDs augments [63]. As a result, CDs with smaller sizes contribute to providing more nucleation sites, thus advancing the hydration of cement to produce more C -S -H gels and Ms. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 8a, owing to the fewest particle quantity and smallest specific surface area of CDs with the largest size (12.37 nm), the nucleation sites in 0.5 H specimen are insufficient. This results in the inadequate contents of C -S -H gels and Ms. Thus, the enhancement of physically adsorptive and chemically binding behaviors is not significant. With the reduction of CDs sizes, the particle quantity and specific surface area of CDs gradually increase. With respect to 1.0 H specimen containing CDs with an average size of 5.79 nm (Fig. 8b), the more nucleation sites endow cement pastes with higher hydration degree, thus generating more C -S -H gels and Ms to immobilize free chloride ions. Regarding 2.0 H specimen containing the smallest-sized CDs (1.73 nm) (Fig. 8c), the smallest CDs can provide the most nucleation sites, thereby enormously advancing the hydration of cement to further produce C -S -H gels and Ms. Therefore, 2.0 H group possesses the highest contents of free chloride binding. In short, CDs are able to provides nucleation sites to promote cement hydration, produce more C -S -H gels and Ms, thereby enhancing the physically adsorptive and chemically binding behaviors for chloride ions. And the smaller the CDs sizes, the more the nucleation sites, and the stronger the enhancement effect on chloride binding in cement.

## 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, this work firstly comprehensively unveils the size-

induced effect of CDs on chloride binding behaviors of cement. Specifically, three types of CDs with different sizes are controllably synthesized by only altering the calcination time of citric acid. And the chloride binding capacity in diverse CDs-modified paste specimens is determined through the equilibrium tests. Crucially, the relevant mechanism is reasonably revealed based on the phase alteration. The main conclusions are shown as follows:

(2) The relationship between chloride binding ability of cement and the sizes of CDs is determined. The specimen containing 0.5 H CDs (24.6 mg/g), 1.0 H CDs (25.7 mg/g) or 2.0 H (30.4 mg/g) increases the C$_{b }$ value by 14%. 19% or 41% than the blank group respectively, after 28-d exposure to the 3 mol/L NaCl solution. Thus, the smaller the sizes of CDs, the more effective the enhancement of chloride binding.

(1) Three classes of CDs with average sizes of 12.37, 5.79, and 1.73 nm are controllably synthesized by changing the calcination of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 h, respectively. The sizes of CDs progressively decrease, as the calcination time increases. These as-prepared CDs represent distinct different sizes, while share identical surface functional groups, similar chemical compositions, and crystallinity.

(3) The effect mechanism of CDs sizes on chloride binding behavior of cement is reasonably proposed through the comprehensive phases analyses. CDs with smaller sizes can more effectively accelerate the generation of C -S -H gels and Ms by nucleation effect, thereby significantly promoting the physical adsorption and chemical binding of cement pastes.

These findings above reveal the effectiveness of CDs sizes on chloride binding in cement pastes. This not only is expected to contribute to promoting the engineering application of CDs, stimulating their industrialization production, but also would extend the service life of RC structures, reducing the CO$_{2 }$emission form cement industry.
