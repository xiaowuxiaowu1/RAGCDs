## 1. Introduction

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have emerged as an innovative solution for renewable energy storage, effectively mitigating persistent energy crises and environmental pollution [1,2]. Their extensive integration across diverse sectors has propelled the global market demand for LIBs [3,4]. The surging demand for lithium (Li), a critical component in LIBs, has amplified [5,6]. Nevertheless, the uneven distribution of natural lithium resources on Earth, coupled with underdeveloped extraction technologies, has significantly strained the supply chain. Projections indicate that discarded LIBs will exceed 11 million tons by 2030, considering their limited lifespan (typically 5-10 years) [7,8]. Inadequate management of retired batteries not only leads to substantial resource wastage but also bears notable environmental consequences.

Advancing the closed-loop recycling of valuable resources from retired batteries is pivotal in reducing the demand for raw materials, facilitating sustainable resource utilization, and supporting environmental conservation [9,10]. Thus, developing efficient recycling procedures is of paramount importance.

Currently, prevalent technologies for recycling retired batteries primarily involve traditional pyrometallurgy/hydrometallurgy methods, widely adopted by numerous companies owing to their suitability for large-scale application [11,12]. Pyrometallurgy necessitates high-temperature smelting, demanding specific equipment, and leading to the depletion of lithium resources and energy, along with the emission of exhaust gases [13,14]. Likewise, hydrometallurgy utilizes strong acid/alkali as leaching reagents, requiring multiple intricate stages and complex procedures to obtain high-purity products, accompanied by the generating tremendous wastewater [15,16]. Conventional lithium extraction from the cathode entails steps such as leaching, precipitation, separation, and purification. The small molecular weight of lithium, usually extracted in the final stage, dramatically impacts the purity

and productivity of lithium recovery [17,18]. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel, eco-friendly, low-energy-consumption, and economically efficient recycling methodologies.

Recently, the concept of directly extracting lithium from lithiated graphite has attracted considerable interest [19,20]. This approach not only bypasses the separation of various transition metals but also simplifies the recovery process of high-purity lithium. In particular, Guo's group [21] reported employing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as carriers of Li$^{+}$, for secure and efficient retrieval of active lithium from lithiated graphite, yielding readily usable lithiation reagents. The extensive applicability of the lithiation reagents, including pre-lithiation and regeneration of electrode materials, has been confirmed in previous studies [22,23] and our recent researches [24,25]. Retrieving lithium resources from the anode represents an innovative and promising approach. Thus, establishing lithium recovery systems at ambient temperature, coupled with a comprehensive understanding of the leaching mechanism and its procedural effects, is essential for facilitating effective lithium recycling. Furthermore, the implementation of the direct recycling technique primarily focuses on refurbishing and regenerating spent electrode materials [26,27]. Achieving more efficient and valuable sustainable utilization of the retrieved lithium resources remains a substantial challenge, pointing toward a promising and eagerly anticipated direction.

Herein, we introduce a facile single-step chemical methodology utilizing PAHs for the direct recycling of active lithium from retired LIBs under ambient temperature conditions. By systematically optimizing extraction reagents, solvents, and process parameters, we achieve an extraction efficiency exceeding 93%. Our investigation reveals the lithium extraction mechanism by analyzing the relationship between the molecular structure of PAHs and extraction efficiency. We extensively analyze the interplay between various PAHs and solvent combinations in terms of productivity, as well as the effects of different leaching processes on the kinetics of lithium recovery. In addition, by harnessing the active lithium solution, we effectively synthesized lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode materials comparable to commercial standards. This strategic approach offers an efficient method for recovering and reutilizing lithium resources from spent LIBs, providing valuable insights applicable to practical production scenarios.

## 2. Experimental

## 2.1. Synthesis of lithiated FP precursors

Commercial iron phosphate (FP) was added to PAHs-Li reagent to initiate lithiation via spontaneous redox reactions at room temperature. Specifically, pyrene (Pyr, 14 mmol) and lithium metal (battery grade, 14 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of 2methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) solvent with equimolar mass. After vigorous stirring for 4 h to complete the reaction, the PyrLi/2-MeTHF lithiation reagent with a concentration of 0.7 mol L - 1 was prepared. Then, 2 g of sand milled commercial FP (the molar ratio of n$_{Fe}$ : n$_{Li}$ = 1:1.05) was introduced into the lithiation reagent solution. After reaction for 2 h under stirring conditions, the mixture underwent filtration to effectively separate the lithiated FP from the solution. The lithium utilization rate was determined to be approximately 98.6% by testing the lithium content in the separation solution. The lithiated FP was washed with 2-MeTHF solvent and a small quantity of anhydrous ethanol. Then, the material underwent vacuum drying at 80 ° C for 10 h to obtain precursors.

## 2.2. Synthesis of LFP

A specific amount of the lithiated FP and sucrose powders (10 wt% of the final theoretical yield of LFP) were combined in a ball milling jar, along with an appropriate volume of ethanol (with a solid content of 40 wt%) and zirconia milling balls (3 mm, maintaining a ball-to-powder mass ratio of 5:1). The wet ball milling process was conducted at 400 r min - 1 for 3 h in a planetary ball mill, followed by additional grinding after drying at 50 ° C. The resulting power underwent annealing at 550 ° C for 1 h, with a heating rate of 5 ° C min - 1 under argon atmosphere, ultimately yielding the LFP samples. Furthermore, various samples were prepared for comparative analysis by adjusting the sintering temperature (400, 450, 500, 550, 600, and 700 ° C) and time (30 min, 1, 2, and 3 h).

## 3. Results and discussion

The lithium recycling process, illustrated in Scheme 1, traditionally begins with discharging spent batteries, followed by disassembling and separating the cathode materials. Next, a mechanical grinding process produces a mixture of metal black powders. Subsequently, a complex hydrometallurgy process is employed to extract and separate individual metal products. In contrast, our proposed approach starts with disassembling fully charged retired batteries to recover lithiated graphite anode materials. Subsequently, active lithium extraction is achieved through a one-step chemical leaching process, facilitated by a PAHs solution at ambient temperature. The lithiated graphite is immersed in the lithium extraction solution, a mixture of PAHs and ether solvents, while ultrasound helps to accelerate the kinetics of lithium extraction. Once the reaction concludes, the active lithium-rich solution and graphite residue undergo separation, and the lithium within the residue is completely extracted through subsequent waterleaching processes. In a departure from prior methods, we directly use the obtained lithium-rich solution to produce new LFP cathode materials, achieving a cyclical use of lithium resources.

## 3.1. Screening principle of PAHs for lithium extraction systems

We selected a range of representative PAHs, including biphenyl (Bp), naphthalene (Nap), p -terphenyl (P-Ter), pyrene (Pyr), anthracene (An), and perylene (Per) (structures shown in Fig. 1a). The selection was guided by several factors: (1) These reagent molecules contain only benzene ring structures, excluding interference from other factors. (2) The chosen PAHs have distinct redox potentials, allowing for investigation into the relationship between their redox potentials and the reversible lithium content. (3) These reagents are cost-effective, offering practical applicability.

Analysis of the lithium content in various fully saturated lithiation reagents (Table S1 online) shows a significant correlation between the maximum storage capacity and the molecular structure of PAHs. Fig. 1b indicates that each independent aromatic benzene ring can store one lithium, resembling the lithium storage mechanism in graphite. Besides, employing the (4 n + 2) rule to calculate the minimum n value corresponding to the number of p electrons in the PAHs molecules correlates with the count of stored lithium. Notably, the anthracene reagent deviates from this trend. This is likely attributed to the most stable configuration when the lithium atom is positioned above the central benzene ring in the anthracene molecule. With the introduction of two lithium atoms, intensified mutual interactions induce bending in the anthracene molecule, leading to their binding in an opposite manner on

adjacent rings. These results have been confirmed in previous literatures [28-30]. The solubility of various PAHs in 2-MeTHF solvent was studied to determine the maximum Li + concentration. Fig. 1c and Table S2 (online) show that Bp, Nap, and Pyr exhibit high solubility (>1 mol L - $^{1}$), while P-Ter, An, and Per has lower solubility (<0.1 mol L - $^{1}$). Thus, Pyr is the best choice to balance the redox potential and solubility of PAHs.

The neutral PAHs molecule with p -p * conjugated interactions facilitate the transfer of the Li's delocalized electrons (Li 2s) to their p orbitals, forming stable PAHs radical anions coordinated with Li + cations due to solvent stabilization. This unique structure characterizes, PAHs-Li as the ''solvated electron solution" (Li-SES), where lithium acts as a charge-compensating cation [31]. The planar p -p * conjugated system of PAHs provides varied electronic affinities and redox capabilities. Cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S1a online) of these lithiation reagents, at identical Li + concentration, indicate a redox potential sequence: Bp > Nap > P-Ter > Pyr > An > Per.

Referring to the redox reaction equation (Eq. (1)) governing lithiation reagents formation, PAHs with higher oxidative potential are theoretically prone to acquire delocalized electrons, thereby enhancing their binding with Li + and facilitating the extraction process. Subsequently, we conducted a comparative analysis of various PAHs' lithium extraction capabilities from lithiated graphite under identical conditions, detailed in the Supplementary materials (online). As expected, higher redox potential in lithiation reagents corresponds to greater extraction of lithium content (Fig. S1b online), indicating a positive correlation between these variables. Notably, Pyr, An, and Per demonstrate the most significant lithium extraction efficiencies, at rates of 85%, 92%, and 93%, respectively.

To validate this finding, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate the electron affinity of various PAHs in combination with 2-MeTHF solvent. The computational results, illustrated in Fig. 1d, reveal a clear negative correlation between redox potential and electron affinity (corresponding molecular models are shown in Fig. 1e). As redox potential increases, the affinity between PAHs and electrons intensifies, increasing the likelihood of acquiring delocalized electrons that transforms into negatively charged anions, thus facilitating their binding with Li$^{+}$. This discovery offers valuable guidance for selecting appropriate lithium extraction reagents.

## 3.2. Extraction of lithium from lithiated graphite

The lithium extraction experiments were expanded upon using lithiated graphite with equivalent active lithium content (details in the Fig. S2 online). Utilizing acid-base titration, we quantified the lithium content in PAHs-Li, lessening the dependence on elemental content detection instruments. We examined the efficiency of lithium extraction from lithiated graphite at room temperature, employing highly soluble reagents (Bp, Nap, Pyr) and different solvation ether solvents, such as 2-MeTHF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) in the lithium extraction solution. Fig. 2a illustrates that in THF, the differing Li + binding affinities of Bp, Nap, and Pyr, based on their distinct redox potentials, lead to varied extraction capacities (Pyr > Nap > Bp). This order confirms that PAHs with higher redox potentials yield higher lithium concentrations.

Fig. 2b elucidates the effects of THF, 2-MeTHF, and DME. The extraction capacity increases as the solvating power decreases (DME > THF > 2-MeTHF, Fig. S3 online) [32]. Weakly solvated solvents facilitate desolvation, enhancing the coordination ability of

Pyr* $^{-}$, with Li + to form Pyr-Li compounds, thus promoting the lithium extraction process [21]. Consequently, Pyr combined with 2-MeTHF offers optimal lithium extraction and exhibits the similar properties to lithiation reagents (Fig. S4 online). Subsequently, a comparison of different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mol L - $^{1}$) was conducted. Fig. 2c shows an increase in the leaching rate with concentration, suggesting that 0.2 mol L - 1 is more suitable. Fig. 2d reveals the influences of soaking, stirring, and ultrasonic techniques on lithium extraction. Ultrasonic assistance accelerates the kinetics of lithium extraction by detaching lithiated graphite from the current collector, exposing active lithium for better interaction with PAHs.

To clarify the extraction mechanism, XRD characterization was used to analyze the phase and structural changes of lithiated graphite electrodes after varying durations (Fig. 2e and Fig. S5 online). Fig. 2f illustrates the temporal evolution of the lithium extraction

solution and lithiated graphite, depicting the phase transition from LiC$_{6}$ ? LiC$_{12}$ ? LiC$_{24}$ ? graphite, which akins to previously reported de-lithiation mechanism [33].

## 3.3. Efficient synthesis of new LFP cathode materials

Lithiation reagents, known for their unique redox characteristics, are extensively used as crucial lithium sources of LIBs, including pre-lithiated anode materials [34,35] and regenerated cathode materials [21,23]. Diverging from previous research, our technique for producing high-performance LFP materials involves the use of recovered active lithium and commercial FP.

The lithiation reagent can be directly employed to react with FP at room temperature, resulting in the reduction of the majority of FP (Figs. S6-S9 online). The initial molar ratio of Li to Fe in the lithiated FP was determined to be around 1.04:1 (Table S3 online).

(e) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and (f) photographs of lithiated graphite after lithium extraction at different times.

Increase time (min)

Then, the lithiated FP underwent wet ball milling with sucrose, ensuring uniform mixing and a reduction in FP particle size (Fig. S10 online), which is conducive to improving electrochemical performance (Fig. S11 online). Thermogravimetric coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) curves in Fig. S12a (online) display an exothermic peak at 412 ° C, signifying a crystallographic transition of lithiated FP around this temperature [36,37]. The XRD patterns in Fig. S12b, c (online) confirm that the samples sintered at temperatures above 450 ° C successfully transformed into the desired LFP phase. Moreover, electrochemical measurements (Fig. S13 online) show that the discharge capacities stabilize beyond 550 ° C but decline with prolonged sintering time. Consequently, the ideal sintering process for lithiated FP is defined to be 550 ° C for 1 h (the samples are designated as LFP).

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 3aand Fig. S14 (online) display a uniformly smooth surface on LFP particles, with an average particle diameter ( D$_{50}$ ) of approximately 1.6 l m(Fig. S15 online). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 3bandFig. S16 (online) exhibit LFP particle surface features consistent carbon layers roughly 2.5 to 3 nm

thick. The carbon content is about 2.93%, which is conducive to enhancing Li + and electron transfer kinetics [38]. The lattice fringes, neatly arranged with a 0.275 nm spacing, correspond to the (301) crystal plane of the LFP phase (Fig. 3c), confirming the high purity and crystallinity. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms reveal a specific surface area of about 20 m 2 g - 1 (Fig. S17 online).

The XRD spectra in Fig. 3d display that the resulting LFP precisely matches the standard card, without any additional impurity peaks. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of LFP and commercial LFP (defined as C-LFP) in Fig. 3e and Fig. S18 (online) reveal that a pair of main peaks at 710.75 and 724.15 eV attributed to Fe$^{2+}$, indicating the absence of Fe 3+ [39,40]. Fig. 3f presents the normalized content of elements excluding Li [41], suggesting a fundamental uniformity in their elemental composition proportion (Table S4 online). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) results also signify a molar ratio of Li to Fe of 1.02:1 in LFP (Table S5 online), representing a favorable atomic proportion and successful preparation of LFP with excellent morphology and structure.

(g) Initial charge/discharge profiles, and (h) cycling performance evaluation of LFP and C-LFP.

The electrochemical performance of LFP and C-LFP samples was evaluated through half-cell testing. The charge-discharge curves in Fig. 3g show that the initial discharge specific capacity of LFP at 0.1 C (1 C = 170 mA g - $^{1}$) is 155.8 mAh g - $^{1}$, comparable to C-LFP (158.6 mAh g - $^{1}$). After 350 cycles at 0.5 C, both LFP and C-LFP exhibited outstanding stability (Fig. 3h), maintaining impressive capacity retention rates of 98.3% and 95%, respectively. Moreover, LFP shows comparable capacities to C-LFP at different rates (Fig. S19 online), suggesting its exceptional rate performance.

To validate the factors contributing to the excellent electrochemical performance of LFP, the electrical conductivity measurements (Fig. S20 online) reveal that LFP exhibits a slightly higher conductivity (833.3 S cm - $^{1}$) than C-LFP (699.3 S cm - $^{1}$) [42]. Additionally, the Nyquist plots in Fig. S21 (online) also confirm that the charge transfer resistance of LFP ( GLYPH<C24> 289 X ) is marginally lower than that of C-LFP ( GLYPH<C24> 345.8 X ). Fig. S22 (online) illustrates that LFP has a lower polarization voltage and superior reversibility of the Li + intercalation-deintercalation process [43]. The Li + diffusion coefficient is shown in Fig. S23 (online), and the slope of LFP is higher than that of C-LFP, manifesting a slightly faster diffusion rate of

Li + and higher reaction kinetics [44]. This discussion highlights the exceptional conductivity and accelerated dynamics of both electronic and Li + transport in LFP, leading to improved electrochemical performance. These findings emphasize the potential for commercial utilization of the LFP prepared through our methodology.

## 3.4. Scale-up of lithium recycling

To assess the scalability of our direct recycling method, we recovered active lithium from commercially retired batteries for integration into the synthesis of LFP cathode materials. As depicted in Fig. 4a, the process involves three main stages: (1) Pretreatment and disassembly of batteries. (2) Extraction and reutilization of active lithium. (3) Preparation of electrode materials and reassembly of new batteries.

Initially, the retired 55 Ah prismatic batteries (with capacity retention below 80%) underwent a charging process, ensuring the incorporation of active lithium into the graphite anode, followed by careful disassembly to isolate lithiated graphite electrodes.

Fig. 4. Scale-up of lithium recycling from retired batteries. (a) Photographs of scalable applications for lithium recycling. (b) Charge/discharge profiles of large-scale prepared LFP in 56 Ah prismatic cells at different cycle numbers. (c) Evaluation of the cycling performance of the 56 Ah prismatic cells. Note: The battery has undergone formation and capacity grading.

Next, the cleaned lithiated graphite electrodes were immersed in the lithium extraction solution (Pyr/2-MeTHF) to directly retrieve active lithium, assisted by ultrasound to promote the kinetics of lithium leaching. It is noteworthy that optimizing the lithium extraction solution (more suitable PAHs and solvents) or the extraction process (heat treatment to accelerate active lithium precipitation [45]) can further facilitate the leaching of active lithium from the graphite. However, in this study, we emphasize the onestep chemical extraction of active lithium under ambient temperature and normal pressure conditions.

Post-reaction, the separation process yielded lithium-rich solutions and graphite containing residual lithium. Since most of the active lithium (with an extraction efficiency exceeding 83%) has already been extracted by PAHs, the reactivity of the graphite residue is prominently reduced. Subsequent consecutive leaching processes with a proton solution (such as water or acid) can be utilized to recover the remaining lithium resources. The active lithium solution can be directly used for the lithiation of commercial FP, and then separated to obtain lithiated FP and PAHs solution. The latter can be reused for active lithium extraction, significantly improving economic efficiency. Afterward, the lithiated FP under-

goes a series of preparation processes, including mixing carbon sources, sand milling, spray drying, sintering, and secondary grinding, to produce large-scale LFP cathode materials for the reassembly of new batteries. Fig. 4b displays the charge-discharge profiles for the initial and 1200th cycles obtained from 56 Ah prismatic cells manufactured utilizing LFP materials. Even after 1200 cycles, the capacity retention rate stands at 90% (Fig. 4c), showcasing its excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, the charge-discharge profiles at various rates in Fig. S24 (online) exhibit relatively consistent capacities, indicating favorable rate performances. These results suggest that the prepared LFP using this technology holds potential commercial feasibility.

## 3.5. Techno-economic analysis

Conventional recycling processes via pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical are complex, expensive, and environmentally harmful. Meanwhile, traditional solid-phase synthesis methods for LFP cathode materials are both energy-intensive and timeconsuming despite the significant demand for LFP batteries. In this study, we have developed a simple method to directly extract

W. Liu et al.

active lithium from spent batteries for LFP synthesis, offering a promising resolution to the mentioned challenges [46,47]. To compare the pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes with our proposed technique (Fig. S25 online), we utilized the EverBatt model developed by the Argonne National Laboratory, considering factors like energy consumption, environmental impact, and potential economic implications [48-50]. The key parameters of various recycling processes were derived from the EverBatt model, along with the specific parameters to our laboratory, and were then used for simulation and calculation.

Energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions serve as vital indicators for developing sustainable recycling systems. As illustrated in Fig. S26 (online), the total energy consumption for pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes amounts is 14.46 and 20.12 MJ per kg cell, distinctly surpassing our direct recycling strategy, which only requires 4.45 MJ per kg cell and minimal GHG emissions. Energy consumption in pyrometallurgy principally arises from high-temperature smelting, while the hydrometallurgical process is mainly associated with the intricate leaching and separation of metals. In comparison, our approach excels in the following aspects: (1) The direct extraction of active lithium from the anodes using a straightforward chemical method, avoiding the necessity for multi-step separation and purification, and without any harmful gas emissions. (2) The residual lithium in the graphite can be directly leached and recovered using an aqueous solution, thus substantially reducing energy consumption.

The difference between our technique and the traditional method primarily arises from obtaining lithium from discarded batteries. We exclusively evaluate the economic feasibility of preparing LFP, with detailed calculations provided in Supplementary materials Note 1 (online). Fig. S27 (online) shows that the profit per kg from directly recycling spent batteries for LFP synthesis ($4.72 per kg cell) appreciably exceeds that of traditional methods ($1.11 per kg cell), representing a profit increase of 43%. Moreover, the sintering procedure possesses lower annealing temperatures and shorter durations, making it more economically and environmentally viable.

It is crucial to emphasize that the reagents operated within closed systems, minimizing the potential for environmental contamination. In addition, owing to the recyclability of the extraction agents (Fig. S28 online), the economic effectiveness is expected to increase significantly with the frequency of lithium extraction cycles, providing an encouraging outlook for industrial applications. However, there are still challenges that cannot be ignored. Primarily, due to the high reactivity of lithiated graphite, precise techniques for disassembling spent batteries are required. Secondly, the crucial focus is on improving the efficiency of active lithium extraction while ensuring the solubility of reagents. While enhancing capability through heating is possible, this approach imposes stricter requirements on the chemical properties of the reagents and solvents. Moreover, the practical implementation not only requires sophisticated facilities but also escalates energy consumption. It is promising that this reagent possesses mild chemical properties (Fig. S29 online). Therefore, the pursuit of improving the lithium extraction efficiency at room temperature holds considerable promise.

## 4. Conclusion

In summary, we establish the feasibility of directly extracting active lithium from spent LIBs using PAHs. We extensively investigate the lithium storage mechanism of PAHs and their relationship between redox potentials and lithium extraction capacities, providing valuable insights for designing efficient lithium extraction

solutions. The systematic screening of reagents and optimization of the process substantially improves the kinetics of the lithium leaching process while simultaneously elucidating the extraction mechanism. Moreover, leveraging the spontaneous redox reaction characteristics of lithiation reagents, the active lithium solution is utilized to synthesize LFP cathode materials comparable to commercial standards. Crucially, the LFP materials prepared in scalable experiments demonstrate exceptional performance in the refabrication of 56 Ah prismatic cells, maintaining a capacity retention rate of 90% after 1200 cycles. Compared with traditional methods, this approach distinctly reduces energy and time costs, thereby enhancing economic efficiency. The chemical leaching method proposed in this research presents an effective strategy for the sustainable recovery and recycling of retired LIBs, with promising prospects for practical production and applications.
