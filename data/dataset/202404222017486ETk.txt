## ABSTRACT

Metal-free electro-Fenton (EF) are a promising technology for environmental remediation. This paper reports a novel EF modified with oxygenated graphene aerogel used as a floating electrode for efficient degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) through improved H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$yield combined with activation of hydroxyl radical ( · OH) production. Impressively, the floating configuration of the electrodes allowed oxygen from the air to diffuse naturally into the reaction interface, reducing additional aeration energy consumption. The current efficiency of the floating system for H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$production was 40 times higher than the conventional vertical mode. The pollutant degradation trend exhibited a positive correlation with the · OH production performance of the electrode. The modified catalyst system achieved the highest · OH yield of 76.48 μ M within 60 min, which was 2.72 times greater than that of the catalyst-free (28.10 μ M) and 2.06 times higher than that of the unmodified catalyst (37.19 μ M). Experiments and theoretical calculations indicated that the oxygen-containing functional groups introduced the graphene skeleton created new sites for in situ activation of electrogenerated H$_{2}$O$_{2}$, resulting in increased · OH production. The primary activation sites were identified as the = O and -COOH groups, with the = O edges playing a particularly significant role. This system offers long-lasting stability and avoids secondary pollution, making it ideal for green environmental remediation compared to the traditional EF process.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) has been favoured for its strong oxidation capacity and thorough degradation [1 -3]. Hydroxyl radicals ( · OH) are generated during the reaction process, which can mineralise almost all organic pollutants and intermediates due to its strong oxidative capacity (oxidation potential of 2.8 V), and is particularly outstanding in treating difficult-to-degrade organic pollutants [4,5]. As a representative type of EAOP, electroFenton (EF) technology generates H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ through a 2e$^{- }$oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode surface, which is then activated by a catalyst (e.g. Fe 2 + or transition metal oxides) to generate · OH (Eqs. (1), (2)) [6 -8].

As a prerequisite for the generation of · OH for pollutant degradation,

the efficient generation of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$is particularly important, which mainly depends on the cathode [9]. Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) is the most widely used strategy to improve ORR efficiency, which usually consists of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) and a catalytic layer (CL) [10,11]. The GDL allows oxygen to be supplied to the cathode surface from the outside and forms a unique gas -solid-liquid three-phase interface in the CL, which improves the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ electrosynthesis efficiency. However, conventional GDE requires air/oxygen aeration with very low oxygen utilisation ( < 0.5 %) [12], resulting in additional energy consumption (0.04 -0.5 kWh m GLYPH<0> $^{3}$) [13]. Therefore, the problem of low oxygen transfer need to be solved for the practical application of GDE devices. Recently, a natural air diffusion electrode (NADE) was designed and applied in an electrochemical system for H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$production [14]. Unlike conventional GDE that require an additional gas aeration device, the NADE can rapidly transport atmospheric oxygen to the cathode by modulating the GDL. In this aeration-free electrochemical reaction system, the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production rate was as high as 102 mg/h/cm$^{2}$. NADE is an ideal cathode to enhance the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$production rate in EF. However, the placement of

its electrode on one side of the reactor poses two problems, including poor utilisation of the oxygen produced at the anode and possible leakage of the solution due to pressure during long-term use. To improve the practicality, this study explores the feasibility of enhancing the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production performance in the mode of electrode floating on the solution without aeration.

Another key step in the EF process is the activation of the generated H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$to · OH. In homogeneous EF, H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$is activated by Fe 2 + , a process that can generate iron sludge and cause secondary pollution [15,16]. To solve these problems, heterogeneous EF uses transition metal oxides loaded on the carrier as catalysts, which slows down the metal leaching to some extent and achieves the reduction of secondary pollution in a wide pH range [17 -19]. However, this does not fundamentally change the drawbacks of metal-based catalysts, i.e., metal shedding affects the stability of catalytic activity and brings about potential secondary contamination. Metal-free catalysts would be a promising new type of EF catalysts, which completely overcome the two inherent drawbacks of metal-based catalysts by activating H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ to · OH (Eqs. (3)) via oneelectron transfer [20 -22].

The development of efficient metal-free electrocatalysts has become a hot research topic in EF. The π -conjugated sp$^{2}$-hybridised carbon and surface functional groups on carbon materials have been identified as active sites for H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$decomposition, acting as electron transfer mediators [23]. The planar structure of graphene, consisting of hexagonal carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice, provides abundant anchor sites for functional groups that are potential metal-free catalysts [24,25]. Many studies have reported B [20,21] and N [26 -28] elements modified graphene-based materials for the degradation of organic pollutants by metal-free EF, and good catalytic results have been achieved. It is inferred that the reaction principle may be the formation of unique electron-rich and electron-poor centres between the carbon atoms on the graphene skeleton and the B/N atoms, which provide one-electron for the activation of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ [29]. However, to date, the B/N modification exists with low doping (B/N content usually less than 10 %, Table S1), which makes the active site density insufficient and limits further enhancement of its catalytic activity [30,31]. In addition, there is a lack of more alternative means of modification beyond B/N. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel modified graphene-based catalysts capable of achieving a high degree of modulation as metal-free EF.

In this study, acidified graphene aerogel (AGA) was prepared by HF hydrothermal method to achieve modulation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the graphene surface by varying the acidification time. It was then integrated with a floating electrode to report the first floating metal-free EF system for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) from wastewater. The floating electrode can supply the system with sufficient electrogenerated H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ to activate · OH production. The oxygencontaining functional groups modify the original sp 2 hybridisation structure of graphene to form new active zones conducive to triggering the activation reaction. The effects of different oxygen-containing groups on the activation of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ for · OH production have been studied experimentally combined with theoretical calculations. This work not only provides theoretical guidance for the design of oxygenmodified metal-free catalysts, but also provide new insights for the further development of efficient EF systems.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Materials

All chemicals were of analytical grade provided by Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory. Graphene oxide (GO) was purchased from Xianfeng Nanotechnology (Nanjing, China). Acetylene black (AB, Liyuan Lithium Battery Company), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, 60 wt%, Daikin Corporation of Japan), and Carbon felt (CF, thickness 2.0

mm, density 0.1 -0.13 g/cm$^{3}$, porosity > 90 %, Tianjin Carbon Plant) were used for electrode preparation. All other reagents had not been further purified prior to use.

## 2.2. Synthesis of AGA

AGA were synthesised by a one-step hydrothermal method using reducing HF as the acidifying agent.Typically, 5 mL HF (40 wt%) was added to a water solution of 30 mL GO (2.0 mg mL GLYPH<0> 1) under ice bath conditions and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min. The dispersion was then transferred to a 50 mL PTFE-lined hydrothermal reaction vessel at 150 · C. The treatment times were regulated (12 h, 24 h, and 36 h) and the corresponding samples were designated AGA1, AGA2 and AGA3. After cooling to room temperature, the prepared samples were rinsed by repeatedly immersing them in deionized water until the solution was neutral. This process removed unstable semi-ionic C-F bonds on graphene. The AGA was further freeze-dried for 36 h for subsequent experiments. For comparison, graphene aerogel (GA) without acid modification was also prepared using the same procedure.

## 2.3. Preparation of floating electrode

A schematic diagram of the floating electrode manufacturing process is shown in Fig. 1a, where the catalyst was fixed to one side of the CF. The detailed process is as follows. First, the CF was ultrasonically cleaned successively in deionised water and ethanol for 20 min, then dried and set aside. The prepared AGA (2 mg) was added to a mixed solution (3 mL anhydrous ethanol and 3 mL deionised water) containing 60 mg of AB and ultrasonicated for 30 min to ensure good dispersion. The PTFE emulsion was added to the mixture in a mass ratio of 4:1 AB/ PTFE. After stirring well, the mixture was coated on the CF one side to act as a catalytic layer. Finally, the desired electrodes were obtained after calcining at 330 · C for 10 min. Electrodes without catalyst were also prepared by the same process.

## 2.4. Experimental equipment and procedures

The H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production and pollutant degradation experiments were carried out in a 100 mL rectangular Plexiglas tank. Unless otherwise stated, The prepared electrodes (2 cm × 3 cm) as cathodes were fixed to float at the interface between the liquid surface and air, ensuring that the liquid surface submerged the CL of the electrodes while the GDL was exposed to the air. A 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm Pt sheet electrode was used as the anode, parallel to the cathode and immersed below the liquid surface. The distance between the two electrodes was fixed at 2.5 cm. For the degradation experiments, the initial concentration of BPA was 10 mg mL GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 80 mL of 0.05 M Na$_{2}$SO$_{4 }$ was used as the electrolyte. The initial solution pH was controlled by 0.1 M H$_{2}$SO$_{4 }$and 0.1 M NaOH. The samples were extracted with a non-sterile syringe at specified time intervals and filtered through a 0.45 μ m filter membrane for analysis. All experiments were performed in triplicate and averaged.

The corresponding characterizations and analytical methods are provided in Text S1 of the supplementary material.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Fabrication and characterization of the floating electrodes

Fig. 1a depicts a schematic diagram of the processing of the floating electrode (see the Methods section for detailed preparation process). As shown in Fig. 1b, CF acted as the GDL and substrate, and AB modified by PTFE was loaded on one side to form a CL. The CF of the GDL consists of fibers with a diameter of about 6.6 μ m, forming an interconnected network with a porosity of up to 90 %. This structure minimizes the mass transfer resistance of oxygen, allowing for spontaneous diffusion of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface. In contrast, the microporous

diffusion layer of conventional GDE have a dense and poorly porous structure, necessitating additional aeration equipment [32]. The electrochemical system of floating electrodes allows for the rapid and natural transport of O$_{2 }$ from the atmosphere to the cathode. This will completely eliminate aeration energy consumption and reduce application costs. In addition to the oxygen transfer from the GDL, the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the CL interface significantly effects on the cathode performance. The thickness of the CL was about 194 μ m (Fig. 1c) and a porous structure formed by a large number of interconnected particles (Fig. 1d). The surface contact angle of 132.4 · has strong hydrophobicity. As reported in many previous literatures [33,34], the hydrophobic CL promotes the formation of a gas -solidliquid three-phase interface at the cathode, thereby enhancing the ORR performance. The source of oxygen supply during H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$production from the floating system was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1e, oxygen was supplied through natural air and anodic oxygen evolution. It is worth noting that the unique top and bottom distribution structure of the

floating electrode makes the oxygen flux generated by the anodic oxygen evolution present an aeration-like effect. This phenomenon can not only enables direct involvement in the reaction as gaseous oxygen at the cathode CL interface, but also indirectly enhance the efficiency of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production by elevating the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the solution. This was confirmed in subsequent discussions.

## 3.2. Comparison of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ generation performance

The EF primarily facilitates the oxidation of pollutants indirectly through the activation of H$_{2}$O$_{2}$, making the production capacity of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ a crucial factor. This study initially examined the impact of different oxygen supply sources on H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production. Three models were categorized according to the relative position of the cathode and anode (Fig. 2a). (I) Floating type: the cathode floats parallel to the liquid surface, facing the anode; the oxygen supply comes from the natural air and the anodic oxygen evolution; when solely investigating the effect of

natural air supply, inert gas nitrogen is introduced into the solution to exclude interference from anodic oxygen supply. (II) Horizontal submerged type: the cathode is submerged parallel to the liquid surface, facing the anode; the oxygen supply is only through the anodic oxygen evolution. (III) Vertical submerged type: the cathode is vertically submerged in the liquid, facing the anode; the oxygen supply is also only through anodic oxygen evolution. Notably, in the vertical submerged type, due to the significant spacing between the cathode and anode, gaseous oxygen precipitated at the anode vertically escapes from the solution due to buoyancy. The ORR of the gaseous oxygen directly arriving at the cathode can be disregarded, thus this process can be considered as a catalytic activity enhancement through the increase of DO only. For comparison, the three modes had the same electrode spacing and were conducted without additional aeration. As depicted in Fig. 2b, after 60 min of electrocatalytic reaction, the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$yields of the three modes were 521.95 mg L$^{-1 }$(I), 99.52 mg L$^{-1 }$(II), and 13.41 mg L -1 (III), respectively. It was evident that the mode of oxygen supply significantly influenced the performance of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$production, with the contribution of air oxygen source being notably higher than that of anodic oxygen evolution. To study the change of DO in the solution between the horizontal and vertical catalytic modes, we replaced the active cathode with a stainless steel mesh. The results (Fig. 2c) indicated that the DO content in the horizontal system exhibited a more rapid increase in the initial 40 min compared to the conventional vertical system. Subsequently, the DO content of both modes stabilized in the following 20 min. Throughout the entire process, the DO content of the horizontal model was higher than that of the vertical model. This was explained by the fact that the oxygen bubbles generated by the anode under the horizontal layout had a larger contact area with the solution

during the escape process, which induced the gas to be fully absorbed, leading to the rapid increase of DO. The lower DO level resulted in mode III exhibiting the worst H$_{2}$O$_{2}$-producing activity.

To evaluate the ORR activity, the LSV of three modes was studied (Fig. 3a). Current response in the floating mode was higher than that in the horizontal and vertical submerged modes, indicating that the floating system significantly improved ORR catalytic activity. This was interpreted as the multi-pathway oxygen supply mode of the system caused a faster ORR response at the electrode interface, which had to accelerate the electron influx rate of the external circuit to maintain the constant voltage polarization. This resulted in obtaining a stronger response current. In the absence of oxygen in the electrolyte solution, the floating system relying solely on air-oxygen source still exhibited a higher response current than the other two modes. At a high polarization potential of GLYPH<0> 1.2 V, it can be inferred from the response current that the contribution of air-oxygen source and anode oxygen evolution to H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production was about 80 % and 20 %, respectively. This suggests that the air-oxygen source plays a dominant role in the ORR, which is further confirmed by means of the chronoamperometric current. As shown in Fig. S1, when natural air was replaced with inert argon, a drastic

Furthermore, the current efficiency (CE) and electrical energy consumption (EEC) for H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$production are the key indicators to determine its large-scale application. As shown in Fig. 2d, the CE of the floating type was more than 5 times higher than that of mode II and nearly 40 times higher than that of mode III during the whole reaction. Additionally, the EEC was also exponentially lower than that of the other two modes. Compared with findings from other reports (Table S2), the developed floating electrocatalytic system has high H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production while balancing high current efficiency and low energy consumption.

decrease in real-time current was observed. The chronoamperometric curves of the three modes, as shown in Fig. 3b, indicated that the floating system had the highest response current with relatively minor fluctuations over time. While modes II and III exhibited a trend of rapid decrease and then stabilizing in real-time current. The initial decrease was attributed to the rapid consumption of DO in solution. The slower stabilization in mode II could be explained by the ability of the parallel mode to rapidly replenish the consumed DO. It should be noted that the signal fluctuations of mode II in late-stage were caused by gaseous oxygen reaching the electrode interface. To analyze the electron transfer number, the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) test was shown in Fig. S2. Subsequently, the influence of current density on performance was investigated. Within the range tested (6 -60 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$), the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production increased with increasing current density. Even at a high current density of 60 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, the ORR was not limited by oxygen mass transfer, and the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$yield reached 1660.39 mg L$^{-1 }$(Fig. 3c). However, increasing the current density led to a decrease in CE (from 71.29 % to 36.36 %). There is still room for further optimization in this regard. Finally, 20 consecutive H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ production tests were conducted to examine the stability of this floating system. As shown in Fig. 3d, the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$production and CE remained stable with a maximum decrease of 7.66 % during operation at a high current density of 40 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$for 20 h, demonstrating the long-term applicability of this floating system.

## 3.3. Characterization of catalysts

The preparation process of AGA catalysts is shown in Fig. 4a. Under acidic conditions, the epoxy and hydroxyl groups on GO are protonated. The epoxy group opens the ring to form a hydroxyl group, and the hydroxyl group is then protonated to form a C-F bond. The hydrogen

bonding effect enhances the stability of the carbonyl and carboxyl groups, inhibiting their conversion to hydroxyl groups and increasing the oxygen content. Eventually, the C-F bond breaks to form a C = C double bond. By adjusting the acidification reaction time, a series of oxygenated graphene-based electrocatalysts can be synthesized. The SEM and TEM mages illustrate the morphological characteristics of GA and AGA3. Both materials exhibited a porous mesh structure of lamellar graphene interconnected with each other, as shown in Fig. 4b and 4e. In contrast to the smooth GA, AGA3 displayed a warped structure with prominently exposed edges. Upon closer examination, it was evident that both materials possessed wrinkled morphologies comprising graphene nanostructures that were aggregated and overlapped with each other, as depicted in Fig. 4c and 4f. High-resolution TEM analysis revealed that the graphene layers consist of fewer layers, and distinct graphene lamellae edges were clearly discernible (Fig. 4d). Abundant defects in AGA3 were confirmed by the presence of numerous " riverlike " disturbed lattice structures and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 4g) [35]. These intrinsic defects were anticipated to function as active sites for the generation and activation of hydrogen peroxide [27]. Furthermore, the lattice spacing of graphene (002) facets increased from 0.334 nm in GA to 0.362 nm in AGA3, primarily attributed to the greater abundance of oxygen functional groups on the surface, as indicated by the XPS results. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) characterization demonstrated the homogeneous distribution of carbon and oxygen elements on the material surface ((Fig. 4h-j).

The impact of hydrofluoric acid treatment on the crystalline structure of graphene aerogel (GA) was examined. As shown in Fig. 5a, the XRD results revealed a distinct diffraction peak at 10.43 · in the GO sample, corresponding to the (001) crystal plane [36]. Following

hydrothermal reduction, the GA exhibited a (002) peak at 24.24 · , indicating the reduction of GO [37]. In contrast, the acid-treated graphene displayed a weaker and broader (002) peak with positional indeterminacy, which may be attributed to the random assignment of oxygen-containing functional groups. The degree of lattice distortion and electronic properties were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the characteristic D band at approximately 1340 cm GLYPH<0> 1 and G band at around 1583 cm GLYPH<0> 1 were evident. The peaks observed at the D band were linked to imperfections, defects, and disorder, while those at the G band were associated with the vibrations of C sp 2 atoms within the two-dimensional hexagonal lattice [38]. The calculated intensity ratios I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$for GA, AGA1, AGA2, and AGA3 were 1.06, 0.97, 1.00, and 0.99, respectively. The marginally lower I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$

values observed in the acid-treated samples were attributed to a more effective repair of the sp$^{2 }$network. The findings from the FTIR analysis revealed that all specimens exhibited four distinct peaks, as illustrated in Fig. 5c. The broad absorption peak observed at 3440 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$was associated with the O-H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group and surface adsorbed water [25]. The C = O stretching vibration originating from the carbonyl group was identified at 1730 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, while the remaining peaks at 1570 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 1200 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$were attributed to C = C and C-OH, respectively [37]. The XPS was utilized to examine the distribution of surface chemicals. As depicted in Fig. 5d, two prominent peaks were identified at binding energies of 285 eV and 533 eV, corresponding to the characteristic peaks of C 1 s and O 1 s, respectively [39]. Following HF treatment, a significant increase in oxygen content was observed

compared to untreated sample, with an increase ranging from 4.38 % to 5.63 %. Moreover, a rising trend in oxygen content was noted with prolonged treatment time, ranging from 17.25 % to 17.49 % to 18.50 %. The augmentation of oxygen-containing functional groups and defects, and subsequently, the presence of more active sites, may contribute to improved reaction kinetics.

## 3.4. Catalytic performance analysis

BPA was used as the target pollutant to explore the EF performance of different catalysts. Obviously, the system without catalyst exhibited the lowest catalytic activity, with only 52.71 % of BPA removed in 60 min (Fig. 6a). In contrast, the addition of catalyst significantly improved the activity of the system and the degradation capacity increased with the elongation of the catalyst acidification time. The degradation of BPA conformed to a pseudo-first-order kinetic model (Fig. S3), corresponding to degradation rate constants (k) of 0.01092, 0.01435, 0.02655, 0.03177, and 0.04385 min GLYPH<0> 1 for no catalyst, GA, AGA1, AGA2, and AGA3 catalysts, respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of the AGA3 also showed strong competition among the many reported metal-free catalysts (Table S3). As expected, the TOC removal efficiency exhibited a similar trend to the BPA, with the highest value of 72.45 % obtained under the AGA3 system (Fig. 6b). This suggested that the system was capable of effective degrading the organic intermediates produced,

mainly · OH that were non-selective for organic pollutants. The similar TOC results for BPA removal can be attributed to the difference in · OH production. This speculation was confirmed by subsequent · OH production results. Correspondingly, the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ yield of the catalyst-free system was 307.03 mg L$^{-1}$, which was similar to that of GA (299.44 mg L$^{-1}$), AGA1 (255.24 mg L$^{-1}$), AGA2 (262.87 mg L$^{-1}$) and AGA3 (280.39 mg L$^{-1}$) (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, these cathode surfaces have similar hydrophobicity as shown in Fig. S4. Strictly, the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$generation on the cathode with catalyst was slightly decreased compared to the cathode without catalyst, which could be attributed to the acceleration of side reactions (Eq. (4) due to faster electron transfer as shown by the Tafel curve (Fig. S5). The above results showed that the addition of catalyst did not significantly affect the H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ yield, but it was able to significantly improve the degradation efficiency and mineralization of BPA.

The concentration of · OH produced at different cathodes was examined (Fig. 6d). Similar to the degradation trend, the AGA3 system had the highest · OH yield at 30 min and 60 min. The · OH content reached 76.48 μ M at 60 min, which was 2.72 times higher than that of the catalyst-free (28.10 μ M) and 2.06 times higher than that of the unmodified GA (37.19 μ M). It was worth noting that there was a mismatch between the high radical yield and the contaminant content. This was

because the mass transfer of contaminants to the electrode interface was an important rate-limiting step [40]. As a result, the produced free radicals could not fully act on contaminant degradation. In any case, the

H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ content of the five different cathode systems can be sufficiently used for free radical production (Eq. (3)). Therefore, the difference in catalytic activity was mainly due to activate H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ into · OH. The CV

curves showed that the electrically active surface area with catalyst was larger than without catalyst (Fig. 6e). This may be due to the introduction of the catalyst providing abundant active sites leading to a higher electrochemical reaction rate. Whereas, the pristine GA and modified AGA3 had similar CV trends, suggesting that the modification might not have brought about a significant change in the active sites. EIS showed that the catalyst-added system had a smaller semicircle than the catalyst-free system (Fig. 6f). This can be interpreted as the introduction of highly conductive graphene catalyst provides better charge transfer for the electrodes.

## 3.5. Possible mechanism for metal-free catalysis

In order to explore the mechanism of BPA degradation by metal-free EF, free radical scavenging experiments were carried out using tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA, · OH trapping agent) [41]. As shown in Fig. 7a, the degradation efficiency of BPA decreased dramatically with increasing TBA addition. Specifically, when 0.2 M TBA was added, the degradation efficiency of BPA decreased from 93.55 % to 63.87 %. Furthermore, with a TBA concentration of 0.5 M, only 55.63 % of BPA was degraded within 60 min. The results indicated that · OH played an important role in the electrocatalytic process. The HPLC spectrum after dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) capture further substantiated the presence of · OH radical. As shown in Fig. 7b, the spectrum exhibited a characteristic peak of the complex (DNPH-HCHO) formed by the reaction of formaldehyde (HCHO), generated by the captured hydroxyl radical, with the derivatizing reagent 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) [42]. The formation of · OH was further confirmed. Moreover, the yield of · OH steadily increased with the reaction time, showing a positive correlation with the BPA degradation process.

To explore the rationale behind the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the modified catalysts, their composition was examined through XPS. In the high-resolution spectra of O 1 s (Fig. 7d), three peaks were observed at 531.7, 533.3, and 533.8 eV, corresponding to the C = O, C-OH, and -COOH groups, respectively [39]. As shown in Fig. 7e, there was minimal difference in the proportions of -COOH groups among the four samples, with values of 0 % (GA), 3.26 % (AGA1), 3.04 % (AGA2), and 4 % (AGA3). The percentage of C-OH groups slightly decreased in all functionalized samples compared to pure GA. Conversely, there was a notable increase in the C = O, with its percentage rising from 5.25 % (GA) to 8.93 % (AGA1) to 9.16 % (AGA2) to 11.21 % (AGA3) with increasing acidification time.

The intermediates generated during the metal-free EF were analyzed by HPLC. As depicted in Fig. 7c, prior to the reaction, the characteristic peak of BPA was observed at a retention time of 6.38 min. Subsequent to the initiation of the degradation reaction, the intermediates peak emerged. It was important to note that the rapid elution leaded to inadequate separation of these product peaks at 3 -4 min. As the reaction progressed, the peak area of BPA decreased continuously, while the quantity of the aforementioned intermediates initially increased and then decreased. This was interpreted as the swift conversion of BPA into intermediates at the early stages of the reaction, followed by their continuous mineralization and decomposition. This process presented a typical pattern of non-selective radical attack, which was consistent with other reports [43].

Through examination of the impact of varying acidification durations on the functional groups, it was deduced that the oxygencontaining on the surface of the catalysts may be accountable for the disparities in electrocatalytic efficacy. To further explore the active sites involved in the generation of radicals, a correlation between the · OH yield and the functional group composition was established. As depicted in Fig. 7f, a positive linear relationship was observed between -COOH/ C = O groups and the · OH yield. Notably, C = O exhibited a significant strong correlation with a high correlation coefficient (R 2 $_{=}$ 0.96), while -COOH displayed a comparatively weaker linear relationship (R 2 $_{=}$ 0.79). Conversely, C-OH demonstrated a negative correlation, indicating

its unfavorable impact on · OH yield. These findings suggested that C = O may play a major role in boosting the formation of · OH.

The calculation of free energies for the selective electrochemical activation of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$to · OH at various sites was conducted. The activation process began with the binding of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$to the surface active sites (*) of the catalyst. Subsequently, *H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$was further reduced to *OH and OH -via the one-electron pathway. Finally, the resulting *OH was desorbed from the catalyst surface to form · OH. As demonstrated in pathway Fig. 8i, the first two steps were barrier-free for all sites. However, there were energy barriers for the release of · OH at the -OH site in the final step. This again confirms that the -OH group is not conducive to radical generation. From a thermodynamic perspective, both = O/ -COOH groups with relatively low energy barriers could activate H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$to produce · OH. Among them, the = O edges group, which had more negative Δ G values throughout the reaction, was the dominant active site for radical production. This discovery sheds light on the activation mechanism of oxygen-containing group types on H$_{2}$O$_{2}$, providing theoretical guidance for the design of new high-performance electrode materials.

The above results confirm a significant correlation between oxygencontaining functional groups in catalysts and the production of · OH. However, the specific mechanism by which functional groups activate H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ remains unclear. To better understand the interaction behavior and preferences, it was analyzed from the perspective of the charge transfer and thermodynamics properties between H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ and oxygen species structures by using DFT calculations. Theoretical modelling was conducted on graphene flakes doped with various oxygen species. Fig. 8a-d represented the fully relaxed atomic configurations of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$in different types of oxygen-containing functional group models, including = O edges, = O defects, -COOH, and -OH). The theoretical L$_{O-O }$ bond length of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ was 1.48 Å. When assigned to different sites, the L$_{O-O }$ bond lengths of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$were 1.499 Å ( = O edges), 1.494 Å ( = O defects), 1.502 Å ( -COOH), and 1.498 Å ( -OH), respectively. The elongation of the L$_{O-O }$ bond suggests that H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ adsorbed around these four oxygen sites was prone to decompose and activation reactions [44]. Fig. 8e-h showed the charge density difference between the oxygen atom structure and H$_{2}$O$_{2}$, indicating that oxygen doping polarises the orbital distribution. The polarised regions, which are mainly located on the oxygen atom and its attached carbon atom, acted as potential active sites. Additionally, there was a significant electron transfer between H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$and the = O edges, = O defects, and -COOH structures. Oxygen (blue bubbles) was considered an electron donor as it accumulates a negative charge. Electrons were transferred from the oxygen atom to the adsorbed H$_{2}$O$_{2}$. In contrast, the -OH structure did not establish an effective electron transfer with H$_{2}$O$_{2}$, and therefore, it was not an effective activation site. The results confirmed the experimental conclusion that doping with = O/ -COOH contributes to the generation of · OH while inhibiting by -OH. In summary, H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$binded more easily to = O edges, = O defects, and -COOH sites in oxygen-containing functional groups, leading to rapid electron transfer and effective activation.

Fig. 8j illustrated the possible catalytic mechanism of the AGAmodified cathode based on the results of the above analysis. Firstly, O$_{2 }$from natural air and anodic oxygen evolution reaction was converted to H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$at the cathode surface through the 2e$^{- }$ORR process. Then, = O/ -COOH acted as the main active site to transfer electrons to the generated H$_{2}$O$_{2}$. Notably, the = O edges played an important role in generating strong oxidizing · OH radicals. The radicals non-selectively attacked the organic pollutants enriched in the cathode region, promoting the degradation of BPA and the removal of solution TOC.

## 3.6. Prospective study of practical applications

The pH application range is a key limiting factor for conventional EF technology. To analyze the performance of the AGA3 metal-free system, a controlled pH effect experiment was conducted. Fig. 9a showed that the degradation curves of BPA at pH 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 almost overlapped. The catalytic degradation of BPA at AGA3 metal-free was not

significantly affected with the pH change from 3 to 11 within 60 min, as evidenced by a decrease in the degradation efficiency of only 2.82 %. The good stability was attributed to the low fluctuation of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$and · OH (Fig. S6). However, the EF reaction process exhibited a different phenomenon. As illustrated in Fig. 9b, at a pH of 3 and with a Fe 2 + concentration of 2.0 mg L -1 (the maximum allowable leaching amount according to EU regulations) [45], the degradation efficiency of BPA was only 56.71 %. Although increasing the iron content can enhance the removal efficiency of BPA, it will unavoidably result in more iron sludge production, leading to secondary pollution. At a Fe 2 + addition of 10 mg L$^{-1 }$and pH 3, the degradation efficiency was 94.05 %, with a degradation trend similar to that of AGA3 metal-free system. For comparison, 10 mg L$^{-1 }$of Fe 2 + was used to investigate the effect of pH on the EF system. As the initial pH increased from 3 to 11, the removal efficiency decreased to 90.41 %, 86.25 %, 77.19 %, and 70.36 %. The overall removal efficiency decreased by 23.69 %, and the degradation volatility was much higher than that of 2.82 % for the metal-free system. For a deeper understanding, the variation of the reaction rate with pH was also investigated in both systems. As illustrated in Fig. 9c, the maximum variation of the reaction rate during EF was 0.02485 min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which was more than five times that of the metal-free EF (0.0048 min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$). This

indicated that the catalytic activity of the constructed metal-free system exhibited excellent stability over a wide pH range. In summary, the AGA3 metal-free system overcomes the limitations of conventional EF while maintaining high catalytic efficiency, not only enlarging the working pH range, but also avoiding secondary pollution.

To comprehensively evaluate the degradation performance of the metal-free system, in addition to BPA, phenol, tetracycline (TC), and methylene blue (MB) were also selected as target pollutants. Fig. 9d shows that the degradation rates of BPA, phenol, TC, and MB were 93.55 %, 95.64 %, 97.28 %, and 71.12 %, respectively, in 60 min. This indicated that the AGA3 metal-free system had a strong oxidation ability for multiple pollutants. After five cycles, the BPA degradation efficiency remained stable with a maximum fluctuation of 4.35 %. The electrode surface was also stable before and after use, with the hydrophobicity decreasing by only 1.6 · (refer to Fig. S7). These results demonstrated the excellent reusability of the AGA3 system. Furthermore, the removal of BPA by this system was investigated in different water matrices, and the corresponding results were presented in Fig. 9f. The water quality parameters of tap water and lake water were detailed in Table S4. The degradation efficiency of BPA were 94.28 %, 93.55 %, and 89.64 % under Up, DI, and tap water matrices, respectively. These values were

significantly higher than the removal rate of 72.46 % under lake water. The reduced performance was attributed to the occupation of active sites by organic matter and inorganic anions in the lake water, as well as competition with BPA for free radicals. The results suggest that this system is both sustainable and practical, and has great potential for application in treatment of organic pollutants in water.

## 4. Conclusions

This work presents an innovative EF based on floating electrodes for the degradation of organic pollutants. The floating system can efficiently produce H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ (1660.39 mg L$^{-1}$) without aeration. Additionally, the unique reaction site of oxygenated graphene catalyst can promote the activation of H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$to produce · OH for high pollutant mineralization. The oxygen supply method significantly impacted the production of H$_{2}$O$_{2}$. Specifically, when the electrode was fully polarized, about 80 % of the oxygen came from the air-oxygen source, while anodic oxygen evolution contributing the remaining 20 %. The highest · OH yield of the modified catalyst system reached 76.48 μ M within 60 min, which was 2.72 times higher than that of the catalyst-less (28.10 μ M) and 2.06 times higher than that of the unmodified catalyst (37.19 μ M). The activation sites were formed by the carbon on the graphene skeleton with attached = O and -COOH functional groups. The reaction rate of the system changed by only 0.0048 min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$at most over the pH range of 3 to 11, indicating exceptional activity stability over a broad pH range. The system demonstrated good sustainability and practicality in repeated experiments and multiple pollution degradation experiments. This work provides theoretical guidance for designing oxygen-modified metal-free catalysts and offers new insights for further developing efficient EF systems.
