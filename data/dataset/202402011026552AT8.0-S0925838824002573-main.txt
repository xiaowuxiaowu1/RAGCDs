## ABSTRACT

Bismuth-based layered ferroelectrics are believed to be promising photocatalysts, but the limited visible-light harvesting and severe charge carrier recombination are still restricting the overall photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a novel 2D/2D Z-scheme Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9}$/BiOBr heterojunction was constructed combining molten salt and hydrothermal synthesis methods. An intimate conjunction between Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9 }$ and BiOBr nanosheets was confirmed which inhibited charge carrier recombination and promoted carrier mobility in the nanocomposites. Benefiting from the optimized charge carrier kinetics and the broadened spectral response range compared to Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9}$, the photodegradation rate of tetracycline hydrochloride by Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9}$/3BiOBr reached 0.0228 min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which was 6.5 and 1.5 times that of Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9 }$and BiOBr, respectively. Furthermore, the heterojunction has also shown satisfactory recycling stability and degradation universality for common organic pollutions including dyes and antibiotics. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis of active species, a 2D/2D Z-scheme Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9}$/BiOBr heterostructure was demonstrated and the possible working mechanisms were discussed. This work is hoped to add another layer of understanding depth to the design and fabrication of 2D/2D Z-scheme heterojunctions of bismuth-based layered ferroelectric photocatalysts.

## 1. Introduction

Bismuth-based layered (BBL) compounds have been receiving increased attention as efficient photocatalysts applied in energy and environment fields in the past decades [1]. The unique layered structure as well as the internal electric field (IEF) derived from the alternatively arranged positively and negatively charged layers in BBL materials have been verified to be conducive to the separation and mobility of photogenerated carriers [2]. As a typical branch of BBL compounds, Aurivillius compounds are composed of alternating stacked bismuth oxide layers (Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$) 2 + and n number of perovskite-like layers (A$_{n-1}$B$_{n}$O$_{3n}$ + $_{1}$)$^{2-}$. A range of Aurivillius compounds have been reported to show intriguing photocatalytic performance in water splitting, organic pollutant degradation, carbon dioxide reduction, etc., such as Bi$_{4}$Ti$_{3}$O$_{12 }$ [3,4] and

As an Aurivillius compound, Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9 }$ (BTNO) has been recently explored as a novel photocatalyst due to the above-mentioned features of layered crystalline structure and IEF [7,8]. Researchers have attempted to modify the photocatalytic performance of BTNO through methods such as doping, defect engineering and facet engineering [9 -11]. For instance, Liu et al. have developed a gradient tungsten doping strategy in Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9 }$to induce an additional electric field along the c axis, facilitating the spatial separation of charge carriers and resulting in an efficient overall water splitting performance [12]. Despite the noticeable optimized photocatalytic performance achieved, there is still vast room for efficiency improvement of BTNO in view of its narrow spectral response range (E$_{g}$ = 3.1 eV) and sluggish charge carrier kinetics.

Constructing heterojunctions is considered as an efficient strategy to steer the charge carrier transportation by utilizing the built-in electric field in the interface between the two components [13,14]. Among the various types of heterojunctions, the Z-scheme heterojunction is becoming increasingly prevalent because it can not only promote the separation of photogenerated charges, but also retain the strong reduction/oxidation capabilities of charge carriers [15,16]. It should be mentioned that apart from the band configuration of a heterojunction, the microstructures of a heterojunction also impacts the overall photocatalytic performance significantly. Different dimensional heterostructures show distinct charge carrier transportation behavior and interface/ surface active sites [17]. 2D/2D heterojunction are attractive due to the large interfacial contact and short carrier transport distance facilitating charge transfer as well as rich active sites provided by the two-dimensional morphologies [18]. Based on the above considerations, construction of a typical Z-scheme 2D/2D heterojunction is expected to optimize the charge carrier kinetics of BTNO, thereby elevating its photocatalytic efficiency. However, studies of BTNO-based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are still rare at present, and a deeper understanding of the effect of microstructure regulation and the working mechanisms are urgently required.

In this work we fabricated a 2D/2D Z-scheme BTNO/BiOBr heterojunction for the first time by combining the molten salt synthesis method with hydrothermal synthesis to optimize photocatalytic performance. BiOBr was chosen to be combined with BTNO in view of its narrow bandgap and a similar bismuth-based layered crystal structure, which may be conducive to a well-matched interface with BTNO [19]. The microstructure of the BTNO/BiOBr heterojunction was studied and its photocatalytic degradation activity against organic pollutants was assessed under visible-light irradiation. Combining theoretical calculations and experimental characterization, the working mechanisms of the BTNO/BiOBr heterojunction were discussed. It was found that the close face-to-face bonding between BTNO and BiOBr provides sufficient contact and high-quality channels for charge transfer. Furthermore, the confirmed Z-scheme heterojunction not only improves the photogenerated charge separation rate, but also retains the high reduction and oxidation abilities of the photogenerated carriers, which is conducive for the overall photocatalytic performance. To our best of knowledge, this is the first report of a 2D/2D Z-scheme heterojunction system based on BTNO. It is hoped that this work can offer fresh perspectives into the rational design and construction of 2D/2D Z-scheme heterojunction of bismuth-based photocatalysts.

## 2. Experimental section

## 2.1. Preparation of BTNO nanosheets

The previously reported molten salt technique was used to prepare BTNO nanosheets [11]. Briefly, the raw reactant materials of Bi$_{2}$O$_{3 }$ (1.3979 g), TiO$_{2 }$ (0.1597 g) and Nb$_{2}$O$_{5 }$ (0.2658 g) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio of Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9}$. Then NaCl and KCl as the salts were mixed with the reactant at a molar ratio of NaCl:KCl: Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9 }$ = 50:50:1. The mixture were ball-milled in ethanol for 4 h, followed by drying and calcination at 800 · C for 2 h. To remove the salts from the product, it was completely washed with hot DI water, and then dried at 60 · C to produce BTNO nanosheets.

## 2.2. Preparation of 2D/2D BTNO/BiOBr heterojunctions

The hydrothermal technique was utilized to synthesize 2D/2D BTNO/BiOBr heterojunctions. 1 mmol of Bi(NO$_{3}$)$_{3}$ · 5 H$_{2}$O was fully dissolved in 30 mL of DI water (containing 6 mL of acetic acid), and then 0.5 mmol of BTNO powder were added in, followed by stirring and ultrasonication for 0.5 h respectively. Next, 30 mL of KBr solution (0.033 M) was introduced into the mixture drop by drop and stirred for an additional 0.5 h. Then the above solution was transferred to a 100 mL

Teflon inner liner and heated at 120 · C for 6 h. After cooling down, the resulting powder was washed using DI water and ethanol several times until the supernatant was neutral, and dried in an oven at 60 · C to obtain BTNO/2BiOBr heterojunction. The other samples of BTNO/ x BiOBr ( x = 3, 5 and 8 ; x is the molar ratio of BiOBr to BTNO) were synthesized in the similar way through adjusting the mole number of Bi(NO$_{3}$)$_{3}$ · 5 H$_{2}$O and KBr. The preparation process of BiOBr nanosheets is similar to that of the composite system except without the addition of BTNO nanosheets. All the raw materials used in the preparation (analytical grade) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

## 2.3. Characterization methods

The phase compositions of the samples were studied using an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, MiniFlex600), and the scanning parameters were set to a range of 10 · to 80 · at a rate of 0.1 · /s. The morphologies of samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S4800) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi) was employed to assess the chemical composition of the elements in the samples, using a monochromatic Al K α source. The samples ' optical features were investigated using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Cary 5000) and their specific surface area was also studied (BET, Micromeritics, ASAP 2460). The steadystate photoluminescence spectra (PL) were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F4600) with an excitation wavelength of 368 nm and the transient photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) of the samples were also recorded at excitation wavelengths of 340 nm. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of active species during photodegradation were also tested using an EPR spectrometer (BrukerA300).

## 2.4. Photocatalytic performance assessment

The photocatalytic performance of the samples was assessed by degrading tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) under visible light. A 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight) with an optical cutoff filter ( λ > 400 nm) were used as the experimental light source. 10 mg of powders and 50 mL of TC solution (10 ppm) were stirred for 1 h in the dark. Then the mixture was illuminated and about 3 mL of solution was taken for sampling every 15 min, followed by centrifuging to remove the powder particles. The absorbance of the supernatant solution was obtained using a UV -vis spectrometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan). In addition to TC, the other common organic pollutants including methyl blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were also used as the target pollutants.

## 2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements

An electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.) was used to test the photoelectrochemical performance of the samples. The test was carried out using a three-electrode system with a Pt plate as the counter electrode, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a working electrode. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 25 mg of 1-naphthol was dissolved in 5 g ethanol and agitation for 0.5 h. Then 50 mg of powder was added to the above solution followed by stirring for 3 h. The obtained homogeneously mixed suspension was then dropped on FTO glass and dried for 12 h at room temperature.

## 2.6. Active radical capture experiments

In order to reveal the role of different active free radicals in the photodegradation process, the photocatalytic degradation mechanism was analyzed by adding various capture agents, including 1 mM EDTA2Na (disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 1 mM IPA

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 980 (2024) 173671 Cui et al.

(isopropanol) and 0.1 mM BQ (1,4-benzoquinone) to capture h + , · OH and · O$_{2}$ -respectively.

## 2.7. Theoretical calculations

The electronic structures of BTNO {001} and BiOBr {010} planes were calculated using the first-principles calculations of density functional theory (DFT) [9]. The uniform generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method was used to describe exchange and correlation interactions. The surfaces of BTNO {001} and BiOBr {010} were simulated. In order to reduce the interaction between repeated plates, BTNO and BiOBr models with a vacuum thickness of 10 Å between the plates were used for calculation. The establishment of a flat plate model involves fixing the two layers of atoms at the bottom and relaxing the remaining layers to obtain surface energy.

## 3. Results and discussion

The preparation flow chart of BTNO/BiOBr heterojunction is shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of samples. The diffraction peaks of BTNO and BiOBr nanosheets coincided with standard orthorhombic BTNO (PDF#73-2180) and tetragonal BiOBr (PDF#78-0348), respectively, demonstrating the successful preparation of pure BTNO and BiOBr. For the XRD patterns of BTNO/BiOBr composites, all the peaks could be attributed to BTNO and BiOBr, and no other impurity phases can be detected. It was found that with the increasing amount of BiOBr, the characteristic peak intensity of BTNO gradually decreased, reflecting the phase composition changes of the BTNO/BiOBr composites.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphologies of the samples. The average side length of BTNO nanosheet was 1.5 µ m (Fig. 1c), and BiOBr also presents a regular two-dimensional nanosheet morphology with a size of about 1 µ m (Fig. 1d). Due to the

fact that both BTNO and BiOBr show a similar nanosheet morphology, it is difficult to distinguish them in BTNO/3BiOBr composites (Fig. 1e). The chemical elements of BTNO/3BiOBr were analyzed using SEMEnergy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS), and the results illustrated a uniform distribution of the various elements (Fig. S1d-j). The distribution regions of Br, Ti and Nb elements are completely coincident, proving the successful preparation of 2D/2D BTNO/BiOBr heterostructures. The SEM images of other samples are also shown in Fig. S1. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to investigate the microstructure of the composite system in more detail. According to Fig. 1f, a few BiOBr and BTNO nanosheets are overlayed tightly to form a well-defined 2D/2D microstructure. The lattice fringes of the phases around the interface (labeled as the square in Fig. 1f) were also analyzed (Fig. 1g). The upper region shows a lattice spacing of 0.28 nm, corresponding to the (020) crystal facets of BTNO. This is in consistent with the reported results and the top exposed facets of BTNO nanosheets were (001)[9,11]. The lower area presents a lattice spacing of 0.28 nm and 0.20 nm that can be assigned to the (102) and (004) crystal planes of BiOBr, and the angle between them is about 45.9 · (Fig. S2a). This angle is in accordance with the theoretical value of the angle between (102) and (004) for tetragonal BiOBr (Fig. S2a, b). This structural information indicates that the exposed crystal plane of BiOBr is (010) [20]. In order to further prove the phase composition, the elemental distribution of BTNO/3BiOBr was determined by TEM-EDS (Fig. 1h and Fig. S3). In the images, the distribution of O, Bi, Br, Nb, and Ti elements are quite even within well-defined regions. It can be seen the distribution region of Nb and Ti is a square that is coincident with the upper rectangular nanosheet, indicating the presence of BTNO. Meanwhile, the Br is located in the lower area, and its distribution shape is consistent with the lower, irregular structure, indicating that this is BiOBr. The EDS results aid in distinguishing between BTNO and BiOBr, and the results are in agreement with the lattice spacing results. Overall, the XRD, SEM and HRTEM results demonstrate the successful fabrication of (001)/(010) face-to-face BTNO/BiOBr composite photocatalysts. It is

worth noting that the measured BET specific surface areas of BTNO, BTNO/3BiOBr and BiOBr are 3.41, 4.77 and 2.54 m$^{2}$/g, respectively (Fig. 2a). The pore size distribution was also shown in Fig. 2a. The pore size distribution of BTNO/3BiOBr is similar to that of BiOBr, and the pore sizes are mainly concentrated in the range of 1.8 -3.3 nm. But BTNO/3BiOBr possess more pores with size over 4 nm than BiOBr. The number of pores (size over 4 nm) in BTNO is between BTNO/3BiOBr and BiOBr. The largest pore number in BTNO/3BiOBr is consistent with its largest BET surface area, which should be related to its typical 2D/2D microstructure [21], which could be beneficial for the photocatalytic degradation.

For the Ti 2p spectra in Fig. 3d, the characteristic peak at 457.9 eV comes from Ti 2p$_{3/2}$. Since the XPS characteristic peaks of Bi 4d, Nb 3 s and Ti 2p overlap in the 460 -470 eV region, the broad peak at 465.0 eV in Fig. 3d can be fitted into three peaks at 462.9 eV, 465.2 eV and 466.6 eV, which respectively correspond to Ti 2p$_{1/2}$, Bi 4d$_{3/2 }$and Nb 3 s [9]. The typical XPS signal of Ti 2p confirmed that the valence of Ti in BTNO and BTNO/3BiOBr samples was + 4 [23]. Fig. 3e shows the XPS peaks at 206.4 eV and 209.3 eV belonging to Nb 3d$_{5/2 }$and Nb 3d$_{3/2 }$of Nb 5 + , respectively [12]. Compared with BTNO, the characteristic peaks of Nb and Ti in the composite sample both shifted to the direction of higher binding energy by ~0.1 -0.2 eV. In comparison, the peak of Br 3d in the composite sample moved about 0.6 eV towards lower binding energy in relation to pure BiOBr (Fig. 3f) [24]. The phenomena described above clearly supports a strong interaction existing between BTNO and BiOBr. Based on the peak shift directions, it can be speculated

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to investigate the samples ' surface chemical state, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3. The binding energy of the spectrum is corrected with the standard reference value of 284.8 eV of C 1 s [11]. It can be seen that the full spectrum of the BTNO/3BiOBr composite is composed of five elements: Bi, Br, Nb, Ti and O (Fig. 3a). As for the high-resolution spectra of Bi, the peak at 164.3 eV in BTNO/3BiOBr belongs to Bi 4 f$_{5/2 }$while the peak at 159.0 eV belongs to Bi 4 f$_{7/2 }$ as shown in Fig. 3b. Compared with the double peaks at 164.9 eV and 159.6 eV in BiOBr, the XPS peaks of Bi4f in the composite photocatalysts move towards to a lower binding energy direction, and their locations are more close to that of pure BTNO [8]. Fig. 3c shows the O 1 s high-resolution XPS spectrum after peak fitting. The O 1 s signal of the composite sample BTNO/3BiOBr is composed of two peaks located near 530.9 eV and 529.7 eV, corresponding to adsorbed oxygen and water (O$_{A}$) and lattice oxygen (O$_{L}$) on the sample surface, respectively [22]. We find that the O 1 s XPS peak of BTNO/3BiOBr is located between that of BTNO and BiOBr, indirectly indicating the successful combination of BTNO and BiOBr.

that electrons flow from BTNO to BiOBr when the two contact with each other, and an intimate junction was formed between the two phases.

In addition, the effect of catalyst dosage, initial concentrations of TC, pH and sodium chloride on the degradation were also studied (Fig. S6). As shown in Fig. S6a, the increase of catalyst dosage provided more active sites, which improved the TC degradation efficiency [26]. In addition, as the pollutant concentration increased, the catalyst had a limited number of catalytically active sites, leading to a decrease in TC removal (Fig. S6b) [27]. As shown in Fig. S6c, the degradation efficiency of TC was enhanced with increasing pH value. In particular, the removal rates of TC were 65 %, 70 % and 76 % at pH 3.1, 7.0 and 10.4, respectively. The improved photocatalytic destruction of tetracycline in an alkaline environment has also been reported by others [21,28]. This is due to the fact that at alkaline conditions pH > 7.7, TC can dissociate into its anionic products, such as TC$_{2}$ -and HTC$^{-}$, which can capture visible light at wavelengths greater than 420 nm, thus stimulating degradation activity [21,28]. In addition, the removal efficiency of TC showed a decreasing trend with increasing concentration of NaCl (Fig. S6d), which may be related to the presence of inorganic salts interfering in the adsorption of target molecules [29]. In addition, TC degradation experiments were also carried out under full light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. S7. As expected, the degradation performance was much improved for all samples compared to the visible-light-only condition, and BTNO/3BiOBr still showed a higher degradation rate than both BTNO and BiOBr, confirming again the superiority of the BTNO/BiOBr herojunction.

By degrading TC under visible light, the samples ' photocatalytic ability was assessed. Fig. 4a shows that the TC degradation percentage of BiOBr and BTNO in 1 h is only 52 % and 18 %. When BTNO and BiOBr are combined, the degradation performance of all composite samples are significantly greater than that of BTNO and BiOBr separately. Among them, BTNO/3BiOBr shows the optimum degradation activity with a degradation percentage reaching 63 % at 60 min. The adsorptiondesorption equilibrium was reached after stirring in the dark for 60 mins, and the adsorption percentage values for samples are very limited (below 5 %) and close to each other (Fig. S4). Therefore, we conclude that the contribution of physical adsorption is minor and the observed differences in degradation between samples should be mainly related to charge carrier kinetics [25]. In addition, the UV -vis absorption curve of the TC solution is shown in Fig. S5, and the characteristic peak decreases with the increase of visible-light irradiation time, which presents a consistent result with the degradation curve. With a further increase of BiOBr content above BTNO/3BiOBr, the degradation rate of BiOBr/BTNO photocatalyst dropped slightly. This may be related to overloading of BiOBr resulting in the reduction of light utilization of BTNO and the blocking of the surface active sites [25]. In order to quantitatively analyze the photocatalytic reaction rate, a quasi-first-order reaction kinetic model was used, and the results are shown in Fig. 4b. According to the slope of the fitted line, the degradation rate of different photocatalysts can be obtained (Fig. 4c). The quasi-first-order rate constants of BTNO, BiOBr, BTNO/8BiOBr, BTNO/2BiOBr, BTNO/5BiOBr and BTNO/3BiOBr for TC are 0.0035, 0.0155, 0.0163, 0.0179, 0.0214 and 0.0228 min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. The degradation rate constant of the optimum BTNO/3BiOBr is 6.5 and 1.5 times that of BTNO and BiOBr, respectively. The photocatalytic performance comparison between BTNO/3BiOBr and the reported catalysts is shown in Table S1, highlighting the advantages of this work in TC elimination.

In order to assess the stability of BTNO/3BiOBr in practical application, a recycling experiment was carried out. It can be seen from Fig. 4d that the photocatalytic activity of BTNO/3BiOBr did not show an obvious decrease after four cycles of experiments. In addition, the XRD results of BTNO/3BiOBr samples before and after recycling tests are shown in Fig. 4e. Fig. S8 shows the SEM images and EDS results of the BTNO/3BiOBr sample after cycling experiments. The morphology and composition of the nanocomposite have not been changed noticeably,

indicating its good stability in the process of photodegradation [11]. In addition to the antibiotic TC, other common organic pollutants existing in wastewater have also been used to test the universality of BTNO/3BiOBr. Nearly 100 % degradation can be observed for methyl blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB), and about 75 % degradation percentage for ciprofloxacin (CIP) were achieved after 90 min irradiation (Fig. 4f).

Therefore, it can be concluded that the photocatalytic degradation performance of BTNO/3BiOBr samples is universal for various types of dyes and antibiotics.

In addition, we have attempted to propose the possible degradation pathway through literature study. We have studied the relevant works which have reported similar active radicals and mechanisms in TC

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 980 (2024) 173671 Cui et al.

degradation[30,31], and the possible decomposition intermediates in the TC photocatalytic degradation was summarized and two possible TC degradation pathways for the BTNO/3BiOBr photocatalyst are proposed as shown in Fig. S9. In pathway A, the tetracycline molecule ( m/z = 445) is converted by demethylation to form A1 ( m/z = 431) and A2 ( = 417) [21]. The reactions of dehydration, deamination, ring opening, and double-bond breakage of A2 under the attack of free radicals give rise to A3 ( m/z = 374), A4 ( m/z = 319), A5 ( m/z = 303), A6 ( m/z = 277), A7 ( = 247) and A8 ( = 165) intermediates [29]. In pathway B, B1 ( m/z = 467) is formed from a tetracycline molecule ( m/z = 445) through a hydroxylation and ring opening process [32]. Then through the processes of demethylation, dehydration, deamidatio and ring opening, B2 ( m/z = 320), B3 ( m/z = 280), B4 ( m/z = 228), and B5 ( m/z = 220) were obtained [25]. With the continuous photocatalytic process under BTNO/3BiOBr visible-light radiation, these degradation intermediates undergo a series of chemical bond cleavage reactions to produce low molecular weight organics with m/z = 109, m/z = 101, m/z = 89, m/z = 85, m/z = 74, and m/z = 51 [26,30]. Eventually, these compounds were further decomposed into to small molecules of H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, NH$_{4}$ + and other inorganic substances.

samples can be measured ( $^{τ}$eff ≈ 1/ $^{ω}$min = 1/2 π f$_{min}$) [34]. Specifically, the electron lifetime of BTNO/3BiOBr (306 ms) is 34.6 times and 10.4 times that of BTNO (8.84 ms) and BiOBr (29.40 ms), respectively.

The catalysts were examined for their light absorption characteristics through UV -vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. According to Fig. 6a, the light absorption edge of BTNO is about 400 nm while the absorption edge of BiOBr is located at about 442 nm. As for the BTNO/BiOBr composites, their absorption edge is sitting between the two pure phases. With the increasing content of BiOBr, the absorption edges of the composites showed a slight redshift. It is reasonable that the introduction of narrow-bandgap BiOBr enlarged the spectral response range of BTNO, which may be beneficial for the photocatalytic activity [36]. The bandgap values can be determined using the Kubelka-Munk equation: F ( R ) = (1R )$^{2}$/2 R , hererin R means the diffuse reflectance of samples [9]. According to the previous reports, BTNO and BiOBr are indirect bandgap semiconductor materials, so the bandgap of BTNO and BiOBr samples can be obtained to be 3.08 eV and 2.80 eV based on the relationship between [F( R )* h ν ] 1/ $^{2 }$and h ν as presented in Fig. 6b. Although BiOBr possess a stronger light-harvesting ability than BTNO/3BiOBr, a better

In order to unveil the mechanisms accounting for the much improved catalytic performance of BTNO/BiOBr heterojunction, we have studied the carrier dynamics by means of photoelectrochemical techniques. Generally speaking, increased photocurrent density indicates more efficient charge separation and transfer [31]. According to Fig. 5a, compared with BiOBr and BTNO, the composite samples shows a higher photocurrent density, which is about 3 times and 3.7 times of that of BiOBr and BTNO. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was also carried out (Fig. 5b). The equivalent circuit model used in the fitting process was also presented. In this context, R$_{s }$ stands for the electrolyte resistance, R$_{ct }$ represents the charge transfer resistance between the electrode and the electrolyte, and CPE is the constant phase element of the electrode [33]. The fitting values of R$_{ct }$in BTNO, BiOBr and BTNO/3BiOBr are 89574 Ω , 567490 Ω and 38097 Ω , respectively. The minimum charge transfer resistance was obtained in BTNO/3BiOBr, showing its fastest charge transfer behavior. At the same time, with the help of Bode phase plot (Fig. 5c), the electron lifetime of

In addition, steady and transient photoluminescence spectroscopy were also employed to further characterize the carrier dynamics. Fig. 5d shows the PL spectra in the 400 -750 nm range for BTNO, BiOBr, and BTNO/3BiOBr with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. It can be observed that BTNO/3BiOBr shows the lowest emission peak intensity, indicating the inhibited electron-hole recombination after the conjunction of BTNO and BiOBr [9]. According to the transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrum (Fig. 5e), the average lifetime of samples can be calculated by the formula $^{τ}$ave = (B$_{1}$ $^{τ}$1 $^{2 $_{+}$}$B$_{2}$ $^{τ}$2 $^{2}$)/(B$_{1}$ $^{τ}$1 + B$_{2}$ τ $_{2}$), where B$_{1 }$and B$_{2 }$are weighting factors, τ $_{1}$, τ $_{2 }$are the radiative lifetimes [9]. The fitting results of the carrier lifetime of all samples are shown in Fig. 5f. Compared with BTNO and BiOBr, BTNO/3BiOBr exhibits a much longer lifetime τ $_{ave}$. Overall, BTNO/3BiOBr shows increased photocurrent density, reduced charge transfer resistance, inhibited carrier recombination and longer charge carrier lifetime. These advantages should be attributed to its special 2D/2D heterostructure wherein the built-in electric field can effectively assist carrier separation [35], which will be discussed in the following section.

photocatalytic performance was observed in BTNO/3BiOBr, which indirectly proves the advantages of the BTNO/3BiOBr heterostructure.

In order to probe the bandgap structures of samples, the valence band maximum (VBM) of BTNO and BiOBr were analyzed using XPS valence band spectra [37], as shown in Fig. 6c and d. The VBM of BTNO and BiOBr are estimated to be at 2.20 eV and 2.45 eV. In fact, the VBM could vary due to the electrical charge disparity between the sample and the measuring device [9]. Therefore the true VBM values can be obtained through the formula E$_{NHE}$ /V = Φ + x - 4.44 for calibration, where E$_{NHE }$ represents the standard electrode potential; Φ is a constant value (4.59 eV), representing the electronic work function of the analyzer; x is the contact potential between the sample and the analyzer obtained directly from the XPS valence band spectrum [38]. Therefore, it can be calculated that the valence band maximum positions of BTNO and BiOBr are at 2.35 eV and 2.60 eV relative to NHE, respectively. Combining the bandgap of BTNO and BiOBr, their conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at GLYPH<0> 0.73 eV and GLYPH<0> 0.20 eV respectively. To further study the energy band structure of BTNO and BiOBr, Mott-Schottky curves have also be employed to infer the band positions[31]. As shown in Fig. S10, the flat band potentials (E$_{fb}$) of BTNO and BiOBr were ascertained to be GLYPH<0> 0.70 and GLYPH<0> 0.17 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. Normally, a positive slope

of the Mott-Schottky curve means that the semiconductor has n-type characteristics, and for n-type semiconductors, E$_{fb }$is usually considered to be located about 0.1 -0.2 V below the conduction band potential (E$_{CB}$) [39,40]. Therefore, it can be inferred that the CBM values for BTNO and BiOBr samples are GLYPH<0> 0.60 V vs. NHE and GLYPH<0> 0.07 V vs. NHE, respectively. These results are close to the conduction band positions obtained from the valence band XPS spectra.

As well known, when two semiconductors with different work functions come into contact with each other, the electrons will flow from the one with higher Fermi level to the other until an equilibrium is achieved [31]. As supported by the XPS peak shift directions observed in Fig. 3, it was speculated that the electrons flow from BTNO to BiOBr. In order to further prove this claim, the work functions of BTNO (001) and BiOBr (010) crystal planes were analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) [37]. As shown in Fig. 6(e, f), the work function of BTNO has been calculated to be 4.94 eV in our former work [9]. Herein, the work function of BiOBr was calculated to be and 5.82 eV, and then the Fermi level (E$_{f}$) of BTNO and BiOBr are then inferred to be at 0.44 V and 1.32 V [24]. Based on the obtained CBM, VBM and Fermi levels, the schematic diagram of the band configuration at the interface of BTNO/BiOBr heterojunction is shown in Fig. 6g [37,41]. When BTNO and BiOBr are in

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 980 (2024) 173671 Cui et al.

contact, due to the difference between their E$_{f}$, electrons of BTNO will move to BiOBr until an equilibrium is reached [37]. Then an internal electric field from BTNO to BiOBr is generated at the heterojunction interface [31]. At the same time, the energy band of BTNO bends upwards, while the energy band of BiOBr bends downwards, which is conducive to the migration and recombination of holes in the VB of BTNO and electrons in the CB of BiOBr towards the interface.

The generation of active species was also studied by PL and EPR. As shown in Fig. 7c, a typical PL emission peak located at 430 nm was observed and its intensity gradually increased during visible-light irradiation. This peak was related to the production of · OH for BTNO/ 3BiOBr under irradiation [33]. The generation of · O$_{2}$$^{- }$was demonstrated by the reactions between nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) and · O$_{2}$$^{- }$(Fig. 7d) [9]. The UV -vis absorption spectral characteristic peak of NBT gradually decreased under 60 min of visible-light irradiation when BTNO/3BiOBr acting as the catalysts, indicating the continuous formation of · O$_{2}$$^{- }$[39]. In addition, the noticeable characteristic EPR spectra assigned to · OH, · O$_{2}$ -and h + were also observed as presented in Fig. 7(e, f) and Fig. S11 when BTNO/3BiOBr was exposed under visible light for 5 min.

In order to further uncover the working mechanisms of BTNO/BiOBr heterostructure, active radical trapping experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. 7(a, b), when 1 mmol/L EDTA-2Na (hole scavenger) was added, the degradation of TC was almost fully inhibited, indicating that h + plays a dominated role during the degradation process. When 1 mmol/L IPA ( · OH scavenger) was added, the degradation percentage decreased from 63 % (without scavenger) to 55 % and the reaction rate dropped by about 35 %, indicating · OH also participates in the degradation reaction, but its role is not as important as holes. In contrast, when BQ was selected as · O$_{2}$ -scavenger, the degradation percentage of TC was significantly reduced to 31 %, indicating that · O$_{2}$ -was a significant contributor to the degradation of TC. Therefore, h + is the main active species in the degradation process of TC, while · O$_{2}$$^{- }$and · OH also contribute to the overall reactions.

In comparison, when pure BiOBr and BTNO were used as catalysts for the detection of DMPO-· OH and DMPO-· O$_{2}$ -EPR signal, both · OH and · O$_{2}$ -can be detected for BiOBr while only the signal of · O$_{2}$ -can be

In summary, the working mechanism of BTNO/3BiOBr composite photocatalyst is proposed in Fig. 9. Based on the analysis of the band structure and reactive species mentioned above, a Z-scheme heterojunction is formed between BTNO and BiOBr. Due to the imbalance of the E$_{f }$between the two semiconductors, energy band bending is generated, forming an internal electric field from BTNO to BiOBr [37]. The flow direction of photogenerated carriers is shown by the arrows. The holes on the VB of BTNO recombine with electrons on the CB of BiOBr, leaving behind electrons with stronger reduction ability on the CB of BTNO and holes with stronger oxidation ability on the VB of BiOBr [31]. Because the CB of BTNO ( GLYPH<0> 0.73 eV vs. NHE) is more negative than the O$_{2}$/ · O$_{2}$ -potential ( GLYPH<0> 0.046 eV vs. NHE) [42], the electrons in BTNO can convert the adsorbed O$_{2 }$ into · O$_{2}$$^{-}$, thereby participating in the degradation. At the same time, TC can be directly oxidized by the holes enriched in BiOBr, which is a major participant in photodegradation. In addition, due to the VB of BiOBr (2.60 eV vs. NHE) being more positive than the · OH/OH -potential (2.38 eV NHE), holes in BiOBr can convert OH$^{- }$into · OH that plays an important role in the degradation of TC. The typical face-to-face close contact between BTNO and BiOBr

observed for BTNO as presented in Fig. 8(a-d). More importantly, the EPR signal intensity of pure BTNO and BiOBr were much weaker than that observed in Fig. 7(e, f), indicating more photogenerated charge carriers in BTNO/3BiOBr heterojunction. Therefore, two possible heterojunction types are proposed as shown Fig. 8e to explain the experimental phenomena observed above. As for the type II model, the electrons will flow from BTNO to BiOBr while holes transfer from BiOBr to BTNO. However, due to the less positive value of the VB in BTNO (2.35 eV vs. NHE) relative to the · OH/OH$^{- }$potential (2.38 eV vs. NHE) [30], the holes on the VB of BTNO could not oxidize OH$^{- }$to generate · OH. This is obviously not consistent with the observed PL and EPR signal of · OH (Fig. 7c and e). Therefore, it is speculated that in BTNO/3BiOBr, · OH is generated at the VB of BiOBr rather than BTNO. As shown in Fig. 8e, in a typical Z-scheme heterostructure, electrons in BiOBr recombine with holes in BTNO while · OH is generated at the VB of BiOBr and · O$_{2}$ -is generated at the CB of BTNO [31]. This Z-scheme heterostructure model explains the experimental results well.

nanosheets provides a high quality interface, accelerating carrier transfer. The formed Z-scheme heterojunction not only improves the separation rate of photogenerated charges, but also retains the high reduction and oxidation abilities of carriers, which is conductive for the overall photocatalytic performance.

## 4. Conclusion

A typical 2D/2D Z-scheme Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9}$/BiOBr heterojunction was constructed by combining molten salt and hydrothermal methods. An intimate (001)/(010) face-to-face BTNO/BiOBr heterojunction was confirmed by HRTEM and XPS. BTNO/3BiOBr showed a significantly enhanced photodegradation rate of 0.0228 min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$for TC, which was 6.5

and 1.5 times that of Bi$_{3}$TiNbO$_{9 }$and BiOBr, respectively. Based on the PL, TRPL and photoelectrochemical results, the composite shows a much improved carrier separation, a reduced carrier transfer resistance and a longer carrier lifetime. This credit was given to the close face-to-face conjunction between BTNO and BiOBr, providing sufficient contact and high-quality channels for charge transfer. The reactive species capture experiments indicated h + is the main active specie while · O$_{2}$ -and · OH also involved in the degradations. Combing the DFT calculation and EPR results, a Z-scheme heterostructure of BTNO/BiOBr was proposed. The formed Z-scheme heterojunction not only improves the separation rate of photogenerated charges, but also retains the high reduction and oxidation abilities of carriers, that is conductive for the overall photocatalytic performance. This work provides new ideas for
