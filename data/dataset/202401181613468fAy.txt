## ABSTRACT

Commercial applications of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from low sulfur utilization, inadequate cell capacity, and inefficient cycling stability, especially under conditions of poor electrolyte and high sulfur loading. Herein, strategies to load sulfur within the wrapped have been proposed, where the large volume expansion and polysulfide diffusion problems can be suppressed. Simultaneously, maximizing sulfur loading is realized. Nanosulfur@ N -modified graphene oxide (S@EGO) wrapped structures were synthesized by electrostatic adsorption method. The sulfur core was formed by the recrystallization, and the graphene oxide shell was decorated with a trace amount of reducing agent ethylenediamine (EDA). The resulting wrapped particle size is 3 ~ 5 μ m, including 20 ~ 50 nm nano-sulfur particle size. N -doped GO (EGO) under suitable temperatures (85 · C) exhibits perfect wrapped state and catalytic activity which gives rise to superior battery performances: the dischargespecific capacity decayed from 1010 mAh/g to 440 mAh/g (900 cycles at 1 C) with an average capacity decay rate of 0.0627 % per cycle. Thermogravimetric analysis that the material prepared by this method reached a sulfur loading of 92 wt%, showing a high prospect of application.

## 1. Introduction

With the penetration of full-power and hybrid vehicles, even higher demands are placed on energy storage batteries [1 -3]. For the time being, the theoretical specific capacity and the theoretical specific energy of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) can reach 1675 mAh/g and 2600 Wh kg GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively, which are much higher than the capacity of commercially used lithium cobalt-acid batteries ( < 150 mAh/g) [4 -6]. Moreover, the advantages of environmental friendliness and low cost greatly enhance its commercial value. However, it cannot be ignored is that some inherent defects exist in LSBs: (1) Sulfur (5 × 10 GLYPH<0> $^{30 }$S cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) and the final products of the reaction (Li$_{2}$S$_{2}$/Li$_{2}$S) have an extremely low conductivity. (2) The difference of densities of sulfur and Li$_{2}$S (2.07 and 1.66 g cm GLYPH<0> $^{3}$) results a volume change of up to 79 % during the charging and discharging process, leading to the change of the cathode electrode morphology and structure. Sulfur was detached from the conductive skeleton, giving rise to capacity attenuation. (3) The polysulfides (LiPSs)

generated by the reduction of sulfur during discharging is easily dissolved in the ether-based electrolyte, increasing the electrolyte ' s viscosity and decreasing the ionic conductivity. Polysulfide ions migrated between the cathode and anode electrodes can reach the lithium anode, and react directly (shuttle effect), causing the erosion of lithium anode [7,8]. (4) Low sulfur utilization caused by these problems leads to LSBs actual energy density and power density being much lower than their theoretical values. Presently, the lack of battery capacity and cycling stability are the dominant issues that prevent the commercialization of LSBs.

Major solutions to the capacity deficiency of the battery are, increasing the sulfur electrode sulfur active species loading, raising the S/C mass and volume ratio of the sulfur electrode, lowering the electrolyte content, and improving the sulfur utilization [9 -11]. Continuing research found that increasing the absolute sulfur content produces more severe deterioration in battery performance, which caused by the following reasons. (1) A large amount of sulfur aggravates the

challenges of battery ' s electronic conductivity. (2) High sulfur loading triggers quantities of dissolved polysulfide, exacerbating shuttle effects, which degrades the coulomb efficiency, capacity and cycling performance. (3) The electrode thickness increases with the increase of sulfur loading, corresponding to the enhancement of electrode polarization [12 -14]. In fact, due to the energy density of a cell is derived solely from the electrochemically active material in the electrode, it is particularly necessary to reduce the mass of the inactive carrier in high sulfurloading cells. Consequently, raising the S/C ratio within the sulfur electrode is considered to be an efficient countermeasure to increase the battery capacity [15,16]. Graphene is an atomic layer of graphite, as a layer of sp$^{2}$-bonded carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal or honeycomb lattice. Because of its special sheet-layer stacking structure, high specific surface area (theoretical specific surface area of 2630 m$^{2}$/g), superior thermal stability, high electrical conductivity, and excellent mechanical flexibility, it supports the achievement of enhanced electrical conductivity of sulfur electrodes as well as improved S/C ratio [17 -19].

For accelerating the electrochemical reaction of active materials, carrier materials with dual functions of conductivity and catalysis are required, in which increasing the catalyst contact area and catalytic active sites on the conductive carrier is extremely critical. Based on this, heteroatom-doped graphene is proposed to form highly dispersed and highly active catalytic reactive sites on the graphene surface as well as lithium ions fast transfer films. In general, due to the high electronegativity of nitrogen atoms, doping into graphene can activate π -electrons, which is conducive to electron transfer. In addition, the introduction of N into the graphene lattice can change the electron distribution around C atoms, and thus ion-selective membranes with fast electron transfer capability can be constructed by changing the polar state and charge distribution on the graphene surface. To effectively address the demand for the physical and chemical properties of electrode structures under high sulfur loading. Li et al. [33] synthesized a reduced graphene oxide (HrGO) microsphere with a layered porous structure (sulfur content of 84.43 wt%). This is prepared by chemically assisted reduction of oxygen-containing groups and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), followed by removal of the silicon template, in which PVP used as a nitrogen source. The authors concluded that the enhanced performance in battery capacity and rate is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the formed graphene thin film hollow structure as well as the doped N. However, the hollow carbon shells prepared in this report rely on the template method, which subsequently undergoes the penetration and the removal of sulfur in highly complex steps [34]. The loading of sulfur using the melt-diffusion method, the filling of sulfur in this way is difficult to ensure that the sulfur encapsulated in the shell will not diffuse out. This also could result in the sulfur becoming inhomogeneous or weakly interacting with the matrix material, which would render a low utilization of the active ingredient [35]. The sulfur particles

obtained are difficult to control, ranging up to 400 nm in size. The large size of the sulfur particles amplifies the defect of sulfur insulating properties. Limited catalytic sites were only distributed on the surface of carbon shell, which severely confined the reactive active surface of sulfur. Meanwhile, the content of pyridine nitrogen, which has high catalytic activity, is difficult to regulate.

In response to the above objectives, a template-free and convenient operation of structure with high sulfur loading was designed. Compound structure with a thin layer of highly conductive carbon as the shell and nano-sulfurs as the core was fabricated. The nano-sulfur particles inside the shell layer are uniformly dispersed on the graphene sheet, allowing the unit sulfur to be efficiently distributed on the carbon layer, which is rich in reactive sites. The requirement of the high density of catalytic active sites and the large reactive area is satisfied while improving the S/ C ratio. The loss of active sulfur material was further blocked by the external carbon shell layer. Based on the recrystallization principle, nano-sulfur particles were prepared by the different solubility of sulfur in two solvents. Accordingly, the deionized water and anhydrous ethanol solutions are used, totally different from the traditional strategy of using toxic solvents such as CS$_{2 }$to dissolve sulfur. This work develops a low-temperature nitrogen doping method to build a modified graphene sheet layer with both conductivity and hydrophilicity. Ethylenediamine (EDA) is used as a surface modifier to modify the graphene oxide (GO) surface making it negatively charged (Fig. S1a) and form an ion-selective film. PEG is used as a surfactant to change the charge distribution on the surface of sulfur (Fig. S1b), resulting in a positive charge on the treated sulfur-containing solution. When the positively charged singlet sulfur nanoparticle cluster suspension is mixed with the negatively charged GO suspension, the phenomenon of GO covering singlet sulfur nanoparticle cluster is generated due to the electrostatic effect, forming S@EGO encapsulated structure composite. Fig. 1 shows the preparation process of S@EGO, which can be simply and efficiently prepared on a large scale.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Materials

Without additional purification, all chemicals were of analytical standard and were used. The chemical reagents such as graphene oxide (2 mg mL GLYPH<0> $^{1}$), sulfur sublimed ( ≥ 99.5 %), polyethylene glycol 4000, ethylenediamine ( ≥ 99 %), and ethanol absolute ( ≥ 99.7 %) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (China) Co., Ltd.

## 2.2. Synthesis of S@EGO composite

Firstly, sulfur powder (120 mg) and PEG-4000 (0.638 g) were completely dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol solution at 80 · C. Secondly, GO (5 mL, 2 mg mL GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water, then a trace amount of EDA (140 μ L) was added, and the modification temperature was maintained at 85 · C for 6 h until the brown GO aqueous solution turned black (labeled as EGO). Finally, the EGO solution was added into the sulfur-containing master mixture at a rate of 2 mL min GLYPH<0> 1 and heated in an oil bath at 80 · C for 3 h. The as prepared material was washed with deionized water then freeze-dried, after which it was heated at 155 · C for 12 h to remove the excess sulfur from the surface. Ultimately, according to the preparation temperature, the material is labeled as S@EGO-T (T = 75, 85, 95 · C). The preparation process of S@GO is the same as that of S@EGO, except that EDA is not required.

## 2.3. Electrodes preparation

The ratio of S@EGO coating material: conductive carbon black: Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) = 7:2:1 was dissolved in N -Methyl-2pyrrolidone (NMP) and stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The slurry was coated on aluminum foil with a thickness of 300 ~ 400 μ m and dried

Until now, inhibition of the shuttle effect is thought to be a comparatively effective one to improve sulfur utilization. The suppression of the shuttle effect has received a great deal of investigation. To begin with, owing to the availability of large internal cavities, a suitable structure (such as core -shell structure [20,21], egg yolk-shell structure [22,23], layer-by-layer encapsulation [24], tubular encapsulation [25], donut structure [26], and other structures) can provide a domainlimiting effect on the shuttle effect and relieve the volume expansion occurring in the cathode electrode, simultaneously maximize the loading of the active substance sulphur [27,28]. Ma [29] et al. fabricated graphene microspheres based on MgO microspheres as a template. The physical domain-limiting effect of this material structure can partially mitigate the shuttle effect. However, improving the electrochemical response of sulfur on the surface of conductive materials is core to solving the shuttle problem. Both the adsorption of soluble LiPSs onto the surface of polar materials and the introduction of catalysts to accelerate the conversion process of LiPSs can help inhibit the shuttle effect [30 -32].

at 60 · C for 12 h. The dried pole pieces were cut into 12 mm round pieces using a slicer. 1 M lithium bis (trifluoro-methanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) as the electrolyte lithium salt, dissolved into 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) solvents in a 1:1 vol ratio, and added with a mass fraction of 2 wt% LiNO$_{3}$. Unless otherwise specified, the sulfur loading in this work is 1.3 ~ 1.6 mg, the sulfur content of the entire cathode is 19.4 %~22.3 wt% based on the formula (1), and the electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio (E/S) is 20:1 ( μ L mg GLYPH<0> $^{1}$). The electrolyte-tosulfur (E/S) ratio and low E/S ratio were controlled to be 20:1 and 7:1, respectively, depending on the sulfur loading of the electrode.

## 2.4. Electrochemical measurements

The CR2025 cells are in the glove box filled with argon gas for assembly, utilizing 1 M LiTFSI dissolved in DOL/DME (1:1, vol) with 2 wt % LiNO$_{3 }$ as the electrolyte and Celgard 2400 polypropylene as the separator. The lithium plate is used as the anode and the S@EGO is used as the cathode. Electrochemical measurements of constant current charge/discharge are measured with the LAND CT 2001A battery system with a voltage window at 1.6 -2.8 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) measurements were performed at a multichannel electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT302N). CV was performed in the range of 1.6 -2.8 V with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. CV curves at different scan rates from 0.1 to 0.4 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$were used to compare the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients. The EIS measurements of the coin cell were performed at an open circuit voltage in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz ~ 100 kHz with a sinusoidal voltage amplitude of 10 mV. Measurements were performed at a current pulse with a constant current intermittent titration technique (GITT) of 0.2 C for 4 min followed by a 30 min rest.

## 2.5. Materials characterization

The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (FSEM, JSM-6700E) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010). Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was measured by NicoletiS5. Surface chemistry was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo scientific MVLTILAB2000). The sulfur content of the samples was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, HCT-1). Raman spectroscopy (Raman) was used to analyze the degree of defects in the material. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, RINT2000 apparatus) was used to obtain the composition of the material, the structure and morphology of the molecules and atoms inside the material. UV Absorption Spectroscopy (UV/Vis) was carried out on an electrolyte

dispersion of S and S@EGO.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Material characterization

As observed by SEM, EGO retains the typical folded morphology of the original GO (Fig. 2a), but the flakes of EGO (Fig. 2b) are thinner and the stacking of the graphene flakes is weaker. It is evident from SEM of S@EGO (Fig. 2c) that evenly spaced nano-sulfur particles are encapsulated by EGO nanosheets. The interconnected EGO nanosheets act as a conductive framework for connecting the sulfur nanoparticles. The particle size distribution of the prepared sulfur was observed by TEM to be in the range of 20 ~ 50 nm (Fig. 2d), this can be confirmed by calculated according to the Scherrer formula (Table S1). We couldn ' t obtain high-resolution images of the sulfur nanoparticles which due to the high-energy electron beam radiation causes the nano-sulfur to sublimate at high speed during the measurement process [36]. A TG test was carried out to determine the sulfur content of the S@EGO wrapping material (Fig. 2e). Pure sulfur evaporates completely until 325 · C and there is a significant weight loss in the range of 180 · C to 325 · C, with a weight loss of 92 %, thus we determined the sulfur content of the material to be 92 wt%.

Here performed Raman spectroscopy on GO, EGO, and S@EGO samples to show the graphitization properties as well as the defect degree of EGO by analyzing the intensity of the D-band and G-band. The characteristic peaks of GO and EGO at 1344 cm GLYPH<0> 1 and 1578 cm GLYPH<0> 1 represent the D-band and G-band, respectively (Fig. 2g). The D band represents the defects and disorder of the carbon lattice, which is the ring breathing vibration mode of the ring of sp$^{2 }$hybridized carbon atoms in grapheme [37]. If the D peak is obvious, it indicates that there are many defects in the material. The G-band represents the in-plane vibrational mode of sp$^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms in grapheme [37]. The different degrees of change in the D and G bands are both caused by the change in the type and number of functional groups in GO because of the doping of ethylenediamine. The intensity ratios (I$_{D}$/I$_{G}$) of the D and G-band of GO, EGO, and S@EGO were calculated to be 0.9967, 1.0727,

In order to confirm the crystalline structure of the sulfur which prepared by the recrystallization method, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on the S as well as the S@EGO material (Fig. 2f). The sulfur we prepared is highly crystalline and exists in an orthorhombic crystalline phase, corresponding to the PDF card (PDF#080247 S). Due to the high sulfur loading of the material, carbon peak is very weak, where the characteristic peaks of sulfur conceal the characteristic peaks of carbon. The slight deviation in the lattice structure and interplanar spacing of the S@EGO material may be owing to the formation of C -S bonds between GO and S. Based on the Scherrer formula calculation results (Table S1), it can be concluded that EDAmodified GO provides superior particle size limitation for sulfur nanoparticles.

and 1.1898, respectively. The I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$ of EGO was greater than 1, indicating that low-temperature N doping caused more structural defects in GO, which demonstrated the substitution of the partial oxygencontaining functional group by the electronegative nitrogen functional group of EDA [38].

The chemical structures of GO and EGO were observed by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2h). The characteristic peaks of GO at ~1726 and ~1055 cm GLYPH<0> 1 belong to the C -O stretching vibration and the C -O stretching vibration of the carboxyl part of the GO edge. The characteristic peaks at ~1405 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$belongs to the C-OH stretching vibration, and ~1110 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$is attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibration absorption peak of C -O -C [36]. It can be found that the peaks of oxygen-containing functional groups such as C-OH and C -O were significantly reduced in the EGO spectra. While the C -C stretching vibrational peak belonging to the graphite sp 2 crystal structure at ~1627 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$was significantly enhanced, demonstrating the reduction effect of EDA on GO. Simultaneously, the peaks appearing at 1635 cm GLYPH<0> 1 are attributed to C -N absorption peaks and those appearing from 1200

to 1025 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$belong to C -N stretching vibration peaks in alkyl groups, which indicate the strong covalent linkage between EDA and GO surfaces [39,40]. The absorption peaks near 2850 and 2920 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in the EGO and S@EGO correspond to the -C -H symmetric stretching vibration and the -C -H antisymmetric stretching vibration, which are the characteristic absorption peaks of the two-CH$_{2}$-groups. While the low peaks near 3600 -3300 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$belong to the N -H stretching vibration peaks in primary amines [36]. The peak appearing at 1650 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$belongs to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group in the amide group. These are all the results of the reaction of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, etc., that exist on the GO sheet layer with EDA. The above results prove that we can reduce GO to a certain extent by using a trace amount of EDA under low temperature hydrothermal treatment as well as achieve the purpose of modified nitrogen doping.

The SEM images of different sulfur@carbon composites are shown in Fig. 3a1 -d2. Compared with S@GO (Fig. 3a1, a2, 10 ~ 15 μ m in size), S@EGO (Fig. 3b1, b2, c1, c2, d1, d2) has a more homogeneous distribution, with a particle size distribution of 3 ~ 5 μ m. The wrapping

behaviors are modulated by the preparing temperature changes. EDA breaks up large graphene sheets to form a cladding layer that controls the growth of sulfur particles. Furthermore, when the temperature continues to rise to 95 ℃ , the oxygen groups on the surface of graphene decrease, resulting in the weakening of the electrostatic force between the core and shell, which in turn leads to the increase of the sulfur particle size. Results show that at the temperature of 85 · C (Fig. 3c1, c2), the particle size of the composite is the smallest and obtains a homogeneous encapsulated state.

To further validate the composition of the materials, the surface chemical composition of S@EGO was analyzed using XPS (Fig. S2, Fig. 3e -g). The total spectrum of XPS indicate that the S@GO material contains three elements of carbon (C 1s), oxygen (O 1s), and sulfur (S 2p), and the S@EGO material contains four elements of carbon (C 1s), oxygen (O 1s), nitrogen (N 1s), and sulfur (S 2p) (Fig. S3). The presence of the N 1s peak proves the successful doping of N in GO under experiment conditions. The chemical environments in which these elements are located in S@GO and S@EGO materials can be obtained from the XPS spectra of C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, and S 2p, respectively. In the C 1s XPS spectra of S@EGO, the appearance of C -N/C -S confirms that N is doped in GO and has a high bonding between N and C. It reveals the chemical bonding between S and EGO, which proves the powerful chemical interaction between EGO and sulfur. In comparison with S@GO, the oxygen-containing functional group content of S@EGO was all decreased, proving the partial reduction of GO by EDA. In particular, at 85 · C, the C -C/C -C ratio is the largest and the oxygen-containing functional group content is the least. The high-resolution S 2p spectrum can be deconvoluted into four peaks (Fig. S3c$_{3}$). The distinctive characteristic peak located at 170 eV is attributed to the S -O bonding peak, which is quite weak in S@GO but strong in S@EGO. The S -O bonding indicates that the oxygen-containing functional groups in EGO can be bonded to sulfur species, which can improve the sulfur affinity/philicity of the electrode and have a positive effect on mitigating the

dissolution/diffusion of LiPSs as well as enhance the electrochemical performance [41]. The types of N in S@EGO are identified as pyridine N (399.1 eV), pyrrole N (399.8 eV), graphite N (401.1 eV), and -NH$_{2}$/ -NO (401.4 eV) (Fig. 3e -g) [42,43]. The presence of -NH$_{2}$/ -NO is attributed to the formation of covalent bonds between sp$^{3}$-C in GO and the amino group in EDA as well as the presence of unreacted-NH$_{2}$, which is consistent with the reaction of EDA and GO oxygen-containing functional groups shown in FTIR. After analyzing the content of different nitrogen (Table S2), it was found that S@EGO had the highest content of pyridine N (34.81 %) and graphitic N (21.48 %) at a temperature of 85 · C. According to the reported works [43,44], lithium ions are effectively adsorbed by pyridine nitrogen, thus obtaining carbon doped materials with high content of pyridine type nitrogen, which dramatically improves the performance of the composites.

## 3.2. Electrochemical performance

Long-cycle performance experiments were conducted for S@GO and S@EGO materials (Fig. 4a, c, S4d). The initial discharge specific capacity of the S@EGO-85 · C material was about 1360 mAh/g at 0.2 C and gradually decayed after 100 cycles about 751 mAh/g (the coulomb efficiency is close to 99 %), which is 2.3 times the capacity of the S@GO electrode. At the other preparing temperatures (75 · C/95 · C), the discharge specific capacities of S@EGO electrodes were lower (676 and 556 mAh/g, respectively). The voltage-capacity curves for constantcurrent charging and discharging of the first cycle of the S@EGO material (Fig. 4b) showed that the LSBs assembled with the S@EGO-85 · C electrode have the highest discharge specific capacity of 1196 mAh/g at 0.5 C. Further, by comparing the polarization voltages of the corresponding oxidation and reduction platforms of the three material electrodes, the lower voltage difference indicates the smaller polarization of the electrodes. The polarization voltage of S@EGO-85 · C (320 mV) is 57 % and 93 % of that of S@EGO-75 · C (554 mV) and S@EGO-95 · C (343

mV), respectively. A more obvious difference in capacity was observed between the electrode cycles at the three temperatures at higher current densities (Fig. 4c). At current densities of 0.2 C and 0.5 C, the capacity of S@GO cells is much worse than that of S@EGO. The voltage-capacity curve of S@EGO-85 · C material at constant current charge and discharge (Fig. 4d) was tested at a current density of 0.2 C (sulfur loading of 1.7 mg cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$). The electrode material has a high reversible specific capacity. While the number of cycles is increasing, its charging and discharging plateaus remain very pronounced, meanwhile the cell exhibits only a slight polarization. Additionally, a more pronounced shortening of the discharge plateau can be observed from the 1st to the 10th cycle, with a larger capacity decay compared to the other cycles, which is likely caused by the low conversion rate of the long-chain polysulfide dissolved in the electrolyte to the solid Li$_{2}$S [41]. The significant voltage drop after 200 cycles and the shortening of the discharge plateau are attributed to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which created by repeated stripping and plating cycles of the lithium anode electrode during the charge and discharge process [41]. This increases the overall overpotential and resistance of the cell [41]. The long cycle performance of S@EGO-85 · C electrodes at high current densities of 0.5 C, 1 C, and 2 C is shown in Fig. 4e. Discharge-specific capacity decreases from the initial 1196 to 618 mAh/g after 440 cycles at 0.5 C, with an average capacity decay rate of 0.1098 % per cycle. After 900 cycles at 1 C, the discharge capacity decreases from 1010 to 440 mAh/g with an average capacity decay rate of 0.0627 % per cycle. The initial

discharge capacity of the S@EGO electrode was maintained at 681 and remained at 400 mAh/g with an average capacity decay rate of 0.0458 % per cycle (900 cycles at 2 C). The N -doped GO layer at 85 · C has a tightly structured interconnected conductive network offering well fixation of the active substances sulfur and polysulfide, thus obtaining good long-cycle performance and low polarization. Here conducted a rate performance on the electrodes (Fig. 4f), it can be observed that the discharge capacity at different current densities is the highest for all S@EGO-85 · C. This can be attributed to the fact that it has highest graphite N content (21.48 %), which increases electronic conductivity and yields excellent rate performance.

High sulfur loading and low E/S are significant constraints to the commercial application of LSBs. The S@EGO cell was tested under the conditions of high sulfur loading (Fig. 4g). The initial cycle discharge capacities of S@EGO were 886.6, 737.5, and 601.9 mAh/g when measured under the sulfur loading of 2.9, 3.2, and 3.5 mg, respectively. After 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 C, the capacities were maintained at 392.7, 284.6, and 217.3 mAh/g. Further, E/S declined from 20:1 to 9:1, achieving a discharge capacity of 858.6 mAh/g in the first cycle and remaining at 472 mAh/g after 100 cycles (Fig. 4h). It demonstrates that the S@EGO electrode can also present good electrochemical performance when exposed to high sulfur loading and low electrolyte sulfur ratio.

## 3.3. Kinetics analysis

The differences in the electrochemical performance of S@EGO cathodes were investigated by CV at 1.6 -2.8 V and a scan rate of 0.1 mV s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. In a typical CV curve, two reduction peaks appear at around 2.2 and 2.0 V, indicating that the reduction of sulfur to lithium sulfide occurs in two major steps. The first peak is at a higher potential corresponding to the reduction of S$_{8 }$to higher-order soluble long-chain polysulfide (Li$_{2}$S$_{n}$, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8), being a solid-phase to the liquid-phase conversion process. The further reduction to low-order insoluble lithium sulfide (Li$_{2}$S$_{n}$, n ≤ 2) was carried out at a lower potential of 1.9 V, corresponding to a liquid-phase to the solid-phase conversion process [45]. As part of the oxidation process, lithium sulfide is converted to sulfur in two steps: in the first step, lithium sulfide converts to an intermediate polysulfide at 2.50 V, followed by further oxidation to sulfur at 2.57 V [46]. It can be observed that the S@EGO obtained a much higher peak current and smaller polarized (Fig. 5a, S4a). In the subsequent cycles (Fig. 5a), the curves overlapped well, demonstrating that the multi-step reaction has high reversibility. Meanwhile, S@EGO with three temperatures showed that positions of the oxidation and reduction peaks reveal the obvious differences (Fig. 5b). Compared with S@EGO-75 · C and S@EGO-95 ℃ , the oxidation and reduction potentials of S@EGO-85 · C exhibited certain negative and positive shifts respectively, indicating the minimal polarization at this condition with the fastest reaction kinetics. To validate the polysulfide conversion, the Tafel slopes corresponding to the CV curves of different electrodes were compared (Fig. 5c). The magnitude of the Tafel slope reflects the kinetic speed of the electrodes during the reaction, with the smaller the slope, the faster the kinetics. As for the second reduction peak, the Tafel slope of the S@EGO-85 · C (110 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) electrode is lower than that of the S@EGO-75 · C (322 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) and S@EGO-95 · C (132 mV dec GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) electrodes by 65.8 % and 16.6 %, respectively. With the smallest Tafel slope at S@EGO-85 · C, which benefits from the highest pyridine nitrogen content at this temperature.

There is a significant promotion effect on the conversion of lithium polysulfide to Li$_{2}$S, accelerating the catalytic conversion rate.

As Fig. S5a -f show the CV curves of the three electrodes at different scan rates. According to the Randles-Sevcik equation, the Li + diffusion coefficient was calculated as follows [47 -49].

where I$_{p}$ , n , A , D$_{Li}$ + , C$_{Li}$ + , and ν represent the peak current, electron transfer number, electrode active area, Li + diffusion coefficient, Li + concentration, and scan rate, correspondingly. Plotting I$_{p }$ and $^{$_{ν}$1/2}$, the slope of the fitted curve and the Li + diffusion coefficient show a positive correlation according to Eq. (2). The larger the slope is, the larger the Li + diffusion coefficient. It can be observed that the electrode slope is the largest at 85 · C, indicating that it has the fastest Li + diffusion rate.

The internal resistance of S@EGO and S@GO electrodes were

To visually verify the powerful restriction effect of the S@EGO on the dissolution of LiPSs, the cell was charged to 2.38 V at a current density of 0.2 C and then measured the shuttle current of the cell at a constant potential (Fig. 5d). Such simplistic and immediate shuttle current measurements provide a convenient observation of the effect of using different additives or host materials to surmount the LiPSs shuttle effect. The general idea of the measurement relies on the decrease in cell potential, which is attributed to the diffusion of polysulfide from the cathode to the anode electrode. Thus, the shuttle current is essentially the Faraday current required to balance the polysulfide shuttle from the cathode to the anode electrode [50]. It can be obtained that the current of the S@EGO electrode drops sharply at 4,000 s and then remains steady, whereas the stabilization time of the S@GO electrode is after 25,000 s, and the shuttle current of the S@EGO electrode is lower than that of the S@GO electrode. This indicates that N -modified wrapping layer forcefully restrains the polysulfide dissolution into the electrolyte which suppresses the shuttle effect.

measured by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) (Fig. 6a and b). During the dissolution phase, the charge/discharge curves of the S@GO electrode showed higher polarization than the S@EGO electrode, indicating that the S@EGO electrode has superior dissolution kinetics. From the voltage-capacity diagram (Fig. 6a), according to the formula, we introduce the internal resistance to visualize the degree of polarization of the electrode during the electrochemical process [48,51]:

Δ V is the voltage difference between the quasi-open circuit voltage point and the closing voltage point, I$_{applied }$ is the current density at constant current. Normalization of the discharge and charge times is performed to plot the internal resistance of the two electrodes, which corresponds to the activation process of Li$_{2}$S at a discharge depth of 1.1 and the conversion of Li$_{2}$S$_{2 }$to solid Li$_{2}$S at a discharge depth of ~0.95. Obviously, the S@EGO electrode has a low internal resistance, which indicates that the charge transfer impedance and interfacial resistance of this electrode are smaller during the charge and discharge process. Meanwhile, the internal resistance of the electrode is significantly larger than that of the dissolution and shuttle phases during the nucleation phase at a discharge depth of ~0.35, which represents the need to overcome higher energy barriers during Li$_{2}$S nucleation. And also implies that the nucleation kinetics of Li$_{2}$S formation is enhanced owing to the S@EGO composed of GO and nano-sulfur after weak reduction by EDA.

The following reaction mechanism can be inferred from the analysis of the S@EGO wrapped structure and comparative electrochemical performance examination (Fig. 8). Graphene possesses high electronic conductivity providing a fast electron transfer network. Nano-sulfur can effectively improve the contact area with carbon material. The resulting

Here the work analyzed the effect of interconnected nitrogen-doped structures encapsulating nano-sulfur on the battery performance by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments. LSBs are different from lithium-ion batteries in terms of embedding and deembedding, which involves a polysulfide conversion process in the electrochemical reaction. The EIS of four materials assembled into a cell is presented in Fig. 7a. All four impedance curves consist of a depressed semicircle in the high-frequency region and a sloping straight line in the low-frequency region, corresponding to the charge transfer impedance (R$_{ct}$) and Warburg impedance (W$_{o}$) [52,53]. Compared with S@GO, the S@EGO-85 · C electrode has the lowest Rct value, indicating it has the lowest charge transfer impedance. The S@EGO-85 · C electrode was tested for cycling, plotting Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit diagrams before and after cycling (Fig. 7b). The R$_{ct }$value after 100 cycles (44.34 Ω ) is significantly lower than the R$_{ct }$ value before cycling (133.7 Ω ) (Table S3).

wrapped structure can shorten the lithium-ion diffusion path. EDAfunctionalized GO acts as a cation exchange membrane to confine sulfur substances on the surface of carbon by electrostatic repulsion and inhibit shuttling. The uniformly distributed negative charge network on the surface of EGO ensures effective adsorption of Li + and generates high-speed transport channels. The defective sites present on the surface of EGO are also essential channels for Li + transport. Wherein, pyridine N contains strong lone pair electrons which effectively adsorbs positively charged Li + as an electron donor. This interaction with lithium is a dipole -dipole interaction, resulting in a well-immobilized polysulfide on the surface of N -doped graphene. A potent interaction between Li + and Pyridine N, which is conducive to the formation of powerful chemisorption with an interface-limited shuttle effect. In particular, the N -doped conductive network exposes more active sites and facilitates the polysulfide catalytic conversion, which can be confirmed by testing the electrochemical active surface area of the S@EGO electrode (Fig. S7).

## 4. Conclusion

Summarizing the characterization and results presented above, the highly conductive thin-layer carbon-covered nano-sulfur structure achieved excellent cycle life and high multiplicity performance under high sulfur loading conditions (Table S4). S@EGO has a wrapped structure with a sulfur loading of up to 92 wt%. In addition to the superior performance at low currents of 0.5 C and 1 C, the initial discharge capacity of the S@EGO electrode was 681 mAh/g at 2 C and remained at 400 mAh/g after 900 cycles. The specific encapsulation structure can relieve the cathode electrode ' s volume expansion. The N of EGO enhances the material ' s electronic conductivity while also acting as an adsorption site for LiPSs, which has a strong immobilization effect and prevents the shuttle effect of LiPSs. The nanoscale sulfur particles can increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the conductive carbon layer to improve the electrical contact and thus limit the diffusion of polysulfide, effectively shorten the lithium-ion diffusion path to render a faster charge transfer rate and improve the utilization of sulfur.

The fabrication of a thin conductive carbon layer depends on this structure, and the conductivity of the GO layer we employ needs to be further enhanced. This, along with the technology for lithium cathode protection, can help to advance the LSBs in commercial applications.
