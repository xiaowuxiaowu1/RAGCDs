## 1. Introduction

Driven by the increasing worldwide consumption of fossil fuels, the exploitation of green and renewable energy systems has nowadays gained tremendous interest. 1,2 Hydrogen energy, as an ultimate clean source, has the potential to be an ideal candidate to replace fossil fuel reserves. 3 -5 Inspired by photosynthesis, photocatalytic water splitting to produce H$_{2}$ is considered the most promising and efficient solution to address the growing demand for energy and attached environmental issues. 6,7 Researches are dedicated to the development of novel avenues including heterojunctions, ion doping, and structural regulation of semiconductors for improving the photocatalytic H$_{2}$ production efficiency. 8 -10 Nevertheless, the currently investigated catalysts for water splitting are mainly based on organic polymers with low energy conversion efficiency. $^{11}$During the photocatalytic process, practical application is limited by the restricted separation and transfer of photocatalytic carriers. 12 Therefore,

fabricating novel functional and earth-rich semiconductors to enhance the photo-conversion and efficient separation of charges is vital for water splitting for H$_{2}$ production.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$) has attracted increasing attention for H$_{2}$ production. Due to its suitable bandgap (2.7 eV) and conduction band potential ( - 1.3 V vs. RHE), g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ meets the energy demands for the reduction of H$_{2}$Ot oH 2 when absorbing part of visible light. 13,14 However, the H$_{2}$ evolution rate of pristine g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ is constrained due to intrinsic restrictions of the visible-light response range and the low separation rate of carriers. 15 -17 For enhancing the H$_{2}$ evolution rate, many modi  cation ways are explored, such as ion doping, 18 -20 structural tailoring, 21 and defect engineering 22,23 successfully. It was reported that most pristine g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ modi  cation studies are concerned with the heterojunction engineering of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ photocatalytic systems for H$_{2}$ production. 24,25 Few research studies have considered the functionalization of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ including hydroxylation and carboxylation on a triazine structure. The effective adsorption and activation of H$_{2}$O molecules on the gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface is a prerequisite for the evolution of H$_{2}$OtoH$_{2}$. Thus, it can be expected that functionalization modi  cation of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ photocatalysts from the perspective of improving the

adsorption and activation of H$_{2}$O molecules could enhance the H$_{2}$ evolution efficiency.

For the adsorption and activation of H$_{2}$Oontheg-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface, the adsorption forces mainly stemmed from the hydrophilicity of the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surfaceandthebindingbetweenH$_{2}$Omoleculesand the functional groups on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface. 26 Wang et al. studied that the hydrophilicity and H$_{2}$O adsorption of HCl-modi  ed gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was improved via the protonation process. 18 Interestingly, Wu et al. combined formaldehyde and melamine at room temperature for introducing the functional groups into g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$,  nding that the binding energy of carbon remarkedly changed, revealing successful modi  cation. 27 Furthermore, the enhanced hydrophilicity of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was attributed to the adsorption of H$_{2}$O which improved the photocatalytic H$_{2}$ production efficiency. According to the above research, it is deduced that hydroxylationmodi  ed g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ might strengthen H$_{2}$O adsorption and activation performance, thus enhancing the corresponding H$_{2}$ evolution efficiency. 28 -$^{30}$In addition, the transfer of active H atoms from H$_{2}$ O via dehydrogenation is a key process in the splitting of water into the H$_{2}$ production system. In a photocatalytic system with water/gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ materials, the reactive H atoms are produced via the dehydrogenationreactionong-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, but the dehydrogenation properties of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ are undesirable due to the restricted hydrophilicity. 31 Therefore, hydroxyl-functionalized g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ should improve the photocatalytic activity in H$_{2}$ production.

Due to the intrinsic properties of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ fabricated using melamine, dicyandiamide, and urea, 32,33 the occupancy of the hydroxyl group within the pristine g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ structure is relatively limited. Up to now, several methods aimed at introducing hydroxyl groups to the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface, but it is difficult to ensure their stability in photocatalytic systems. 34 In addition, during the thermal condensation process, the incomplete

deamination reaction of melamine, dicyandiamide, and urea could result in the formation of abundant unsaturated carbon within the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ structure. 18,19,21,22 During photocatalysis, the unsaturated carbon is usually slightly attached to the methyl hydroxyl group (C -OH) in solution to gain activity. 32 -34 Inspired by the combination of melamine and formaldehyde, 35 it is expected that the unsaturated carbon on g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ could be integrated with the methyl -hydroxyl group (C -OH) in formaldehyde solutions.

In this work, we report a facile method to synthesize Ccoupled hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ by reacting g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ with formaldehyde at a moderate temperature. The hydroxyl groups on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface could enhance its surface functionalization and photocatalytic activity. The modi  ed g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ exhibits a remarkable hydrogen production rate of 3.554 mmol g - $^{1}$, which is 11.18 times higher than that of pristine g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ attributed to the C-coupled hydroxylation of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ by various characterization techniques. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the reaction with formaldehyde alters the work function and band gap of the material, facilitating charge separation and transfer. The experimental results also demonstrate that hydroxyl groups promote the cleavage of water molecules on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface, improving the catalytic performance. This work offers a novel strategy and method for developing metal-free catalysts based on functionalized g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$.

## 2. Results and discussion

## 2.1 Characterization of the pure and formaldehyde-treated CN materials

Typically, C-coupled hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ photocatalysts were fabricated via a combined thermal-condensation and

hydrothermal treatment route. The schematic description corresponding to the preparation of CN -m-n is depicted in Scheme 1. The pristine g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was obtained through a thermal polymerization reaction of melamine calcined at 550 °C for 4 h at 5 ° C min - $^{1}$, which exhibited the feature of a triazine ring structure. A  erward, the solution mixture including BCN and formaldehyde was sonicated and vigorously stirred at 85 °C for 2 h. Brie  y, the unsaturated carbon in the triazine rings combined with the aldehyde group at a certain temperature to produce novel functionalized g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ containing C-coupled hydroxyl groups.

The phase structures of BCN and formaldehyde-treated gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ samples were recorded through X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. From Fig. 1A and S1, † all synthesized materials exhibited similar XRD patterns including two featured diffraction peaks at around 27.41° and 13.02°, ascribed to the (002) and (100) planes of BCN, which were assigned to the in-plane repeat of heptazine groups and p -p interlayer stacking of aromatic heterocycles, respectively. 35,36 However, samples with different treatment temperatures at the same treatment time showed a signi  cant decrease in the intensity of the above two peaks compared to BCN, indicating the slight devastation of the ordered structure of inter-plane p -conjugated stacking. Under different treatment times at the same temperature, the samples displayed slightly changed diffraction peaks from 27.41° to 27.25° of the (002) plane as the time lengthened, implying the decrease in the inter-plane distance a  er interpolating -OH (hydroxyl) into the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ framework. Therefore, the above analysis revealed that the inter-planar heptazine packing of BCN was slightly destroyed a  er formaldehyde thermal treatment, but the basic triazine ring structure was well maintained.

The FT-IR spectra were obtained to explore the functional groups before and a  er formaldehyde treatment. Similar typical features of all samples are depicted including BCN and CN -m-n (Fig. 1B), indicating that the basic chemical frameworks of gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ a  er formaldehyde treatment were retained. Speci  cally, the broad bands between 3000 -3500 cm - $^{1}$were attributed to N -Ho rO -H stretching vibrations from H$_{2}$O adsorption. The typical peaks at 1200 -1600 cm - 1 were assigned to C -NorC ] N in unique conjugated heterocycles of the melon frameworks. 37 The sharp peaks at 810 cm - 1 correspond to the out-of-plane bending vibration characteristics of tris -triazine groups. 38 However, it was worth noting that two direct differences were observed in the FT-IR spectra of C-coupled hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$. The BCN fabricated at 550 °C was constructed of more triazine rings containing C ] N and C -N by chemical bond forces. 39,40 But as the temperature and reaction time in the formaldehyde solution increased, the peak intensity of C ] N was decreased, indicating that the C ] N bonds within the triazine ring frameworks were broken, and thus, unsaturated carbons were formed and further combined with formaldehyde to produce the Chydroxylation structure with strong hydrophilicity corresponding to the results of the contact angle test. The above information implied that the chemical frameworks of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ treated with formaldehyde were not destroyed, while the hydroxyl group content was signi  cantly increased. Speci  cally, in the formaldehyde solution, unsaturated carbon atoms in the triazine ring

combined with the aldehyde group to form stable C -O bonds via chemical bonding forces, while the introduction of -OH did not lead to a random stacking on the planar structure, but changed the layer spacing of the conjugate stacking using its stretching vibration mode.

The chemical composition and successful introduction of hydroxyl groups on the triazine ring through the formaldehyde reaction were further veri  ed by XPS measurement and TGA analysis. There are only the three elements C, N, and O in the survey of BCN and CNm-n samples, suggesting the puri  cation of materials (Fig. 1C and S2A † ). As for the O 1s spectra (Fig. 1F), the intensity of the spectrum at 533.6 eV belonging to H$_{2}$O gradually decreased on increasing the treatment temperature and time, while the intensity of the spectrum at 532.7 eV corresponding to the C -O single bond gradually increases, proving that the hydroxyl unit on the surface of the formaldehydetreated samples was not induced by the adsorption of H$_{2}$O molecules, but by the reaction with formaldehyde. The shi  in peak position also supported the above inference. The atomic percentage of the O element in BCN was lower than that in CNm-n samples (5.32%), indicating the successful introduction of the hydroxyl group. From XPS results, the C/N atomic ratio of CN was calculated to be 3/3.86, similar to the theoretical value towards pure BCN. Moreover, the atomic ratio of C/N in CN -m-n was signi  cantly close to that of pure BCN, indicating the stability of the triazine ring structure. The results of the peak splitting of C 1s and N 1s of CNm-n further prove the above presumption. From the C 1s spectra in Fig. 1D and S2B, † with increasing temperature, the intensity and contribution ratio of the peaks belonging to C ] C gradually decreased, while the intensity of the C -O unit progressively increased. Moreover, due to the nucleophilic addition reaction of the aldehyde group of formaldehyde with the C atoms in g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ frameworks, a hydroxyl-containing hybrid structure was generated, 31 resulting in slight shi  s of the peaks positions of C -O. This structure could further increase the length and p -electron density of the conjugated system of CN, thus reducing the bandgap and improving its visible light absorption ability. 41,42 Additionally, the fractional peaks of N 1s of formaldehyde-treated samples did not change signi  cantly, further demonstrating that the hydroxyl group is bound to the carbon atoms in the triazine ring. From the TGA curves (Fig. S3 † ), a more pronounced weight loss was noted for CN-85-2 compared to BCN. The weight loss around the temperature from 0 -100 °C was attributed to the loss of internally absorbed water molecules, while the weight loss in the temperature range of 100 -500 °C is linked to the thermal decomposition of the groups within the framework. Therefore, it is apparent that the mass loss of C-coupled hydroxylation groups is quicker than that of the BCN. TGA analysis indirectly veri  ed the presence of extensive hydroxyl groups on CN-85-2. Based on the above analysis, it is reasonable to suppose that BCN a  er nucleophilic addition with formaldehyde still possessed an intact triazine ring framework. Furthermore, the C ] N groups exhibited an unstable state in the reaction solution leading to the combination of aldehyde groups with unsaturated carbon atoms for the fabrication of a high-activity functional photocatalyst.

Before and a  er the modi  cation of formaldehyde on gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$, the morphology and photo-response activity were re- ected in SEM, TEM, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As

shown in Fig. 2A -D and S4, † both pristine and C-coupled hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ displayed a similar stacking of irregular layers. The gap between the layers of the formaldehyde-treated

g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ samples increased, while the lamellae-like stacking density decreased, which was consistent with the TEM observation. The morphology difference demonstrated that the introduction of -OH groups slightly changed the layer spacing of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$. The formaldehyde molecules entered within the gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ structure through surface modi  cation. The UV-vis performance and bandgap energy of the synthesized samples are exhibited in Fig. 2E and F. It was worth noting that BCN before and a  er formaldehyde treatment displayed similar photo-response features and bandgap energy. 43 The samples were prepared at 85 °C for 2 h corresponding to a wide absorption range ( l = 480 nm), which was consistent with the best photocatalytic hydrogen production activity a  erward. An identical bandgap energy of around 2.70 eV was observed for all g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ samples, implying that the introduction of -OH groups has less in  uence on its photo-response features. In addition, the speci  c positions of the conductive band and valence band of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and other samples were measured by using Mott -Schottky plots and XPS-VB spectra (Fig. 2G, H and S5 † ). Noteworthily, the conductive band and valence band potential of the samples remained unchanged a  er formaldehyde treatment. Similar results were observed in materials treated at the same

temperature for different times, indicating that the C-coupled hydroxylation process does not damage the framework of gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$.

## 2.2 Photocatalytic activity of formaldehyde-treated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ before and a  er samples in hydrogen conversion

To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the synthesized samples in hydrogen evolution, the photocatalytic H$_{2}$ production activity was tested in a 10 vol% aqueous TEOA system under visible light ( l > 400 nm) irradiation with 3 wt% Pt used as a co-catalyst. Based on the preliminary performance measurements, pristine BCN exhibited inferior photocatalytic hydrogen production activity (0.318 mmol g - $^{1}$), while the formaldehyde-treated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ displayed excellent performance. Fig. 3A and B revealed the time-dependent H$_{2}$ evolution efficiency of the pristine and C-coupled hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ systems. Compared to pure BCN, the formaldehyde-treated gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ exhibits increased H$_{2}$ evolution activity. Among all the fabricated samples, CN-85-2 possessed the best performance (3.554 mmol g - $^{1}$), which was 11.18 times higher than that of pristine BCN under the same experimental conditions a  er 6 h

irradiation. The C-coupled hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ fabricated in this work exhibited superior photo-energy conversion efficiency in photocatalytic H$_{2}$ evolution compared with the reported functional g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$. In photocatalytic systems, pristine BCN still possessed a poor H$_{2}$ evolution efficiency under the dual effects of sacri  cial agents and co-catalysts, indicating that the introduction of the hydroxyl group is the key to improve the photocatalytic activity of samples. Furthermore, according to the comparative experiments, no hydrogen production was found with catalyst-free and visible-light-free systems (Fig. S9 † ), suggesting that the above conditions were necessary to affect the H$_{2}$ evolution rate in the photocatalytic system. Moreover, the H$_{2}$ evolution activity was signi  cantly improved when hydroxyl groups were anchored on the frameworks of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, proving that the modi  cation of the hydroxyl unit on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ structure has a positive effect. The stability of the photocatalysts is also an important factor for photocatalytic performance. A  er  ve continuous cycles (total reaction time of 30 h), hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ exhibited excellent stability (3.219 mmol g - $^{1}$). The XRD and FT-IR results of the samples before and a  er use revealed that the anchored hydroxyl groups on the surface of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ did not decompose under visible light irradiation and still maintained the intact frameworks (Fig. 3D and S6 † ). In addition, the hydroxyl groups within the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ structure were not induced by the in  uence of adsorbed water. Experiments were performed by subjecting the CN-85-2 sample to annealing at 100 °C at different times, and the changes in its photocatalytic properties were further observed (Fig. 3C). The results showed that the hydrogen production rate of the samples still maintained a good photocatalytic activity under visible light, which proved that the gra  ed hydroxyl groups in the framework of the triazine ring were not produced by adsorption of water molecules, but by chemical bond coupling. Based on the above analysis, the Ccoupled hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ obtained a  er formaldehyde treatment possessed improved photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency with the introduction of hydroxyl groups in the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ frameworks.

## 2.3 The mechanism of C-coupled hydroxylated CN improving photocatalytic H$_{2}$ evolution

Photocatalytic hydrogen production based on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ system is a typical three-phase catalytic reaction. According to the previous analysis, the main factors for the enhanced photocatalytic H$_{2}$ evolution activity of C-coupled hydroxylationmodi  ed g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ were investigated from the perspective of morphology, speci  c area, photo-response features and bandgap structure. Therefore, the basic characterization and bandgap structure internal charge transfer pattern were not responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL spectra (TRPL), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and photocurrent response (TPR) were implemented to explore the photogenerated carrier production, separation, and transfer features of the fabricated samples. It was demonstrated that while the introduction of hydroxyl groups had signi  cantly changed the photo-response properties of the samples,

photoinduced carrier separation and migration increased remarkedly, especially by the PL results (Fig. 4A), which revealed the weakest intensity of CN-85-2 at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm, indicating the highest photogenerated electron and hole transfer efficiency. Fig. 4B exhibited the TRPL curves of the as-fabricated samples. The calculated average lifetime values of pristine and formaldehyde-treated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ were 5.54 and 4.10 ns, respectively. The results demonstrated that the modi  cation of hydroxyl groups retarded the photoinduced charge recombination and enhanced the possibility of carriers participating in the hydrogen production process. EIS and TPR analysis also veri  ed the above speculations. From the water contact angle test, it is noticeable that CN-85-2 exhibited a smaller water contact angle compared to pristine BCN (Fig. 4C), proving that the introduction of hydroxyl groups increased the hydrophilicity of the samples. Additionally, the speci  c surface area of CN-85-2 was slightly higher than that of pure BCN (Fig. S8 † ), which facilitated the adsorption of more water on the catalyst surface and thus improved the water splitting efficiency of the samples.

The H + protons on the catalyst surface were closely correlated with the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production. The surface electronegativity of the sample before and a  er formaldehyde treatment was measured. As depicted in Table S1, † a  er formaldehyde treatment, the samples had lower electronegativity compared to the pristine BCN, which facilitated the adsorption of protons (H$^{+}$), while accelerating the escape of H$_{2}$. Speci  cally, the lower electronegativity of the formaldehyde-treated samples was closely related to the surface gra  ed -OH. It could be inferred that the temperature and reaction time have a profound effect on the number of -OH groups on the catalyst surface, which promoted the rearrangement of the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface charge and thus in  uenced the electronegativity of the samples. According to the previous analysis, the -OH groups introduced on the formaldehydetreated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ frameworks had excellent effects on the generation, separation, and migration of the photoinduced carriers and photocatalytic performance, and further enhanced the activity of photocatalytic decomposition of water via increased H$_{2}$O adsorption capacity.

Moreover, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the samples at a speci  c wavelength ( l = 420 nm) was calculated. From Fig. S7, † pristine BCN exhibited no hydrogen evolution, while CN85-2 possessed a stable AQY (2.05%), demonstrating the superior H$_{2}$OtoH 2 conversion of the materials a  er formaldehyde treatment.

## 2.4 Theoretical calculation analysis

In addition, we also classi  ed the structure and density of states (DOS) variation of hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ via DFT. The detailed calculation procedure is shown in the ESI. † The bandgap energy calculated from the DOS of BCN (1.941 eV) is slightly smaller than the actual bandgap energy obtained from the Tauc results. The calculation results were reasonable due to the bandgap limitation of the generalized gradient approximation algorithm and the error in the approximation generalization. In this case,

however, the calculated C-coupled hydroxyl g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ results are still available. It was worth noting that the introduction of the hydroxyl groups signi  cantly increased the CB potential of g-

C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, which led to a substantial enhancement in the capacity of water splitting. Furthermore, the contribution values of both the CB and VB of BCN and CN-85-2 were obtained from the p

and s orbitals, respectively. The photogenerated electrons were transferred from the s orbitals of C and N atoms to the p orbitals of O atoms to achieve effective hydrogen production. The

computational results validate the suppressed carrier complexation efficiency and excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of hydroxylated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$.

The work functions of BCN and CN-85-2 were calculated to be 5.627 and 3.912 eV, respectively. Considering the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, 4.5 eV), the Fermi levels of the samples were determined to be 1.127 and - 0.588 eV, respectively. Due to the electronic migration from the higher Fermi level to the lower Fermi level to maintain the charge equilibrium state, more electrons were accumulated in the materials within the lower Fermi level to facilitate photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Based on the above analysis, the mechanism of hydrogen evolution was proposed. As shown in Fig. 5, under visible light irradiation, the cyano group of CN-85-2 absorbs light energy to produce carriers and achieve separation. Furthermore, Ccoupled hydroxylation functionalized g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ constructed by the intimate combination of the hydroxyl group on the surface and the triazine ring realized fast electron transport. A value of 1.941 eV was calculated by DFT, which was close to the experimental value, and the CB and VB potentials of the samples were analyzed via XPS-VB and M-S results. The hydroxyl unit could adjust the position of the CB potentials to meet the energy level requirement to achieve water splitting, further implying the strong H$_{2}$ escape ability of CN-85-3 of the photocatalytic hydrogen production system.

## 3. Conclusion

In conclusion, g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ photocatalysts were C-coupled hydroxylation-modi  ed via a reaction of the formaldehyde solution with the unsaturated carbon of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, for the efficient evolution of H$_{2}$. Compared to pure g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, the C-coupled hydroxylated-gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ exhibited superior efficiency about 11.18 times in H$_{2}$ production in the photocatalytic system. Although the introduction of -OH on the surface of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ did not destroy the morphology, photo-response activity, and triazine ring structure, the band position, carrier migration properties, and H$_{2}$ evolution markedly improved. Therefore, the C-coupled hydroxyl-g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ surface is more favorable for H$_{2}$O adsorption and H$_{2}$ escape. This work provides new insights into fabricating highly efficient and stable functionalized photocatalysts from a structural optimization perspective.

## 4. Experiment

## 4.1 Sample preparation

Pristine g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was fabricated via the traditional thermalcondensation treatment. Experimentally, melamine (C$_{3}$H$_{6}$N$_{6}$, Shang Hai, China, AR, 2.5 g) was placed into a ceramic boat and covered by aluminum foil. The white powder was directly heated in a tube furnace from room temperature to 550 °C for 4 h at 5 ° C min - 1 under a stable N$_{2}$  ow. A  er cooling down naturally, bright yellow powders were collected, ground, ultrasonically washed, centrifuged and dried at 60 °C. Pure g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ is denoted as BCN herein.

For the construction of C-coupled hydroxyl groups on the CN surface, pristine g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was mixed with formaldehyde solution (Keshi, China). Typically, BCN samples (0.2 g) were treated with formaldehyde solution (20 mL, 37 wt% in water) and then the

mixed suspension was continuously stirred at 85 °C for 2 h. A  er this, the prepared g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ powder was ultrasonically washed with distilled water and ethanol, and centrifuged several times. The target g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ with C-coupled hydroxylation was collected by drying at 60 °C in air. In order to optimize the preparation of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ powders, the above mixed suspensions were stirred and processed at 65, 75 and 95 °C for different times (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h). The formaldehyde-treated g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ powders were denoted as CNm -n ( m = 65 °C, 75 °C, 85 °C, or 95 °C, n = 1h,2h,3h,4h,and5h).

## 4.2 Sample characterization

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance (Germany) instrument, using a Cu K a radiation source ( l = 1.54 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA) at 10° min - $^{1}$. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA LMS) coupled with EDS analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20, FEI, the Netherlands) were carried out to record the morphology of the resultant g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ powders. A Nicolet iS50FTIR instrument was used to collect the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrum in the range from 4000 to 400 cm - $^{1}$. X-ran photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scienti  c ESCALAB Xi+ instrument (Al K a X-ray source) to explore the chemical states of the samples. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of materials was performed on a METTLER TOLEDO instrument in the range from 5 to 800 ° C at 2 °C min - 1 under N$_{2}$  ow. N$_{2}$ adsorption -desorption isotherm measurements was carried out and UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Nova Station A (Quantachrome) and Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer (Germany), respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was carried out on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer at 370 nm as the excitation wavelength. Time-resolved PL decay curves (TRPL) were obtained on an FLS1000  uorescence lifetime spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm and a probe wavelength at 475 nm.

## 4.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements

The mixed suspension including 3 mg of catalysts and 1 mL of distilled water was prepared a  er ultrasonication. The suspension was uniformly coated on the surface of the FTO substrate dropwise. The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode including Pt foil as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and the materials as the working electrode on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation with 0.2 M Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ electrolyte to obtain transient photocurrent and Mott -Schottky plots. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained at frequencies ranging from 10 5 to 10 - 1 (amplitude: 10 mV) in the 1 mM K$_{3}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$] electrolyte.

## 4.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiment

Photocatalytic hydrogen production was investigated using an automatic gas circulation (Labsolar-6A) system equipped a 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd, l > 400 nm). Experimentally, 10 mg catalyst was ultrasonically

dispersed in 100 mL 10% TEOA aqueous solution containing 3 wt% H$_{2}$PtCl$_{6}$ $ 6H$_{2}$O as the cocatalyst. The temperature in the reactor was maintained at 5 °C using a circulating condensate system under stirring. A  er being vacuumed for 30 min to remove air and injection of 20 mL Ar as the carrier gas, the experiments were carried out. The amount of H$_{2}$ evolved was analyzed per hour by using an online GC-FL9790II gas chromatography system with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Besides, the cycling experiments of H$_{2}$ evolution were performed by repeating the above experimental operation multiple times.

## 4.5 Apparent quantum efficiency (AQY)

The apparent quantum efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is calculated based on the ratio of the electron consumption rate to the incident photons, eqn (1) is given below. The AQY was calculated under monochromatic light using a 300 W Xe lamp ( l = 420 nm) equipped with bandpass  lters. The reaction was performed at 5 °C under stirring. The AQY is obtained by using

## 4.6 DFT calculations

DFT calculations were carried out with the CASTEP module to model the hydroxylation group and the valence electrons. The generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) of the Perdew -Burke -Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used to explore the exchange correlation calculation. During the calculation process, a 350 eV kinetic cutoffenergy and a 2 × 2 × 1 k -point mesh were used for structure optimization. Under the above settings, the maximum force, maximum displacement, maximum stress, and self-consistent  eld (SCF) tolerance were set as 0.03 eV Å - $^{1}$, 0.001 Å, 0.05 GPa, and 1.0 × 10 - 6 eV per atom, respectively. The band structure and potential density of states (PDOS) of the samples were calculated a  er geometry optimization.
