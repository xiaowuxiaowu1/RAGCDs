## 1. INTRODUCTION

The granular photocatalyst reduces fossil energy consumption by generating clean hydrogen energy from water in the presence of sunlight, thereby alleviating energy shortages and reducing carbon emissions. 1 - 3 There is a wealth of energy in the sun's rays. It can directly split water into hydrogen and oxygen under deep ultraviolet light irradiation. 4 In the presence of a photocatalyst, the wavelength of the light that breaks down water can be extended to the ultraviolet, visible, and even infrared regions. 5 - 7 An ideal photocatalyst needs to have good absorption of sunlight, particularly to visible light, as it takes the major fraction of the solar spectrum. The metal-free g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$-based materials are well-known sunlight photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). They adopt layered structures, which are mainly composed of tri-s-triazine units linked by amino groups, for which a schematic plot is shown in Figure 1 a. The g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ photocatalyst has the advantages of a proper bandgap for sunlight utilization, a suitable electronic band structure for the reduction of H + to H$_{2}$, nontoxicity, light stability, low cost, and facile synthesis. 8 However, it has the disadvantage of low charge separation efficiency due to many internal defects, which makes the observable photocatalysis not good enough. 9

Nowadays, the use of design composites is the common and effective strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity for HER, mainly attributed to its synergistic effect. 10 The synergistic effects possessed by composites in photocatalytic applications are often reflected in four areas, such as optical properties, electron transport properties, light-induced charge separation, and photocatalytic properties. 11 For example, the famous TiO$_{2}$ photocatalyst has outstanding charge separation capability but its light absorption ability is limited to the UV range; 12 combining TiO$_{2}$ spheroid and g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ together in composites can obtain photocatalytic H$_{2}$ evolution rate of about 286 μ mol/h/g under sunlight, which is 3.4 and 2.3 times higher than those of single TiO$_{2}$ and g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ materials, respectively. 13 In short, the synergistic effect is to make the photocatalytic performance of the composites superior to that of the uncompounded material. Most of all, compared with the

three-dimensional networks, two-dimensional materials have the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratios, high anisotropy, and facile fabrication and thus have received considerable interest in the fabrication of composite photocatalysts. 14 Recently, a novel layered material, MXenes, has attracted wide attention in the photocatalytic HER 15 , 16 as a cocatalyst due to their high specific surface areas, the abundance of surface active sites, and the good electron transport capacity. 17 The MXenes have been also used in the composite photocatalysts, and the chemical composition of the common composite is Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$. In Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, the layered network consists of Ti - C bonding forming edge-sharing octahedral CTi$_{6}$ units, and the outer Ti layer in the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ layer has different bonding surface groups due to the different exfoliation preparation methods ( Figure 1 b). 17 The Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ composites have been reported to display 10 - 26 times higher photocatalytic HER performance than that of single gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ 18 , 19 However, the photocatalytic activity of the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ composites still has space for improvement from the point of view of commercial application.

Apart from the binary composites, the incorporation of a third component, such as TiO$_{2}$, Pt, and black phosphorus, to construct a ternary composite with g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ is a useful attempt. Pt as a cocatalyst has been shown to highly enhance the photocatalytic activity of HER of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$. The H$_{2}$ evolution rate of the Pt/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ ternary composite is more than 15 times higher than the pure g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ under simulated sunlight irradiation. 20 While the TiO$_{2}$/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ composite showed a highly stable photocatalytic activity in HER, up to 15.29 mmol/h/g, which is 18.8 times higher than pure g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ under visible light ( λ > 400 nm) irradiation. 21 The heterojunction has been fabricated by using Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, and black phosphorus, which led to a H$_{2}$ evolution rate 47.2 times higher than that of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ under visible light ( λ > 420 nm) irradiation. 22 More rational designs of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$-related ternary composite photocatalysts are necessary for further enhancing their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates. Moreover, the general stability issue of MXenes against oxidation due to their high number of defects caused by the preparation process 23 is also a major concern for the photostability of the MXene-containing composites, which need verification through the cycling experiments ideally in ultralong periods. 24 , 25

In this paper, Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ ternary composites were designed in order to enhance the ability to absorb visible light, improve the charge separation efficiency, increase the reactive sites, and therefore achieve excellent HER performance over the long term. In the designed Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ ternary composites, g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was modified by copolymerization of malonamide and melamine, which is a derivative of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and together with Au particles led to the stronger visible light absorption; meanwhile, both the Au particles and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ enhanced charge separation and provided more active sites

for redox reactions. The resultant ternary composites showed an H$_{2}$ evolution rate of ∼ 120 μ mol/h/g with remarkable photocatalytic stability in a 120-h-long cycling experiment, demonstrating the potential application in HER. Possible photocatalytic mechanisms for the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ ternary composites were investigated based on the first-principles calculations.

## 2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

2.1. Synthesis. 2.1.1. Chemical Reagents. Melamine (Macklin, 99%), Malonamide (Macklin, 98%), Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ (Feyman Biotechnology), hydrochloric acid (Sinopharm, 36 - 38%), triethanolamine (Macklin, 98%), chloroauric acid (Macklin, Au ≥ 48%), and ethanol (Aladdin, 99%) were used in the experiments without further purification. The deionized water was used in all of the experiments.

2.1.2. Modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ Nanosheet (CN-n). The modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ nanosheets were obtained by a thermal copolymerization method using melamine and malonamide as raw materials. The synthesis was carried out as follows: 5.000 g of melamine and n mg of malonamide were placed in a mortar, 8 mL of ethanol was added for grinding until the ethanol evaporated completely and naturally, and then the mixture was transferred to a corundum crucible. Subsequently, the powder was first calcined at 550 ° C for 4 h, followed by another calcination for 2 h at 500 ° C. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were ground finely, leading to the final products for preparing the composites. These modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ samples were named according to CNn as CN-0, CN-50, CN-100, CN-150, CN-200, and CN-250 depending on the amount ( n mg) of malonamide. As the CN-150 samples achieved the highest hydrogen evolution rate among these samples, the CN-150 samples were used to prepare the following composites where the modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ is referred to as CN150. A schematic diagram of the synthesis of the composite photocatalysts herein is given in Figure 2 .

2.1.3. Au/CN-150 Binary Composites. Au particles were assembled on CN-150 by in situ photodeposition, during which chloroauric acid was photoreduced to Au particles. The amount of chloroauric acid was calculated based on the designed mass percentages ( y %) of gold in the CN-150 sample. The Au/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ binary composite samples

were named as 1Au/CN-150, 2Au/CN-150, 3Au/CN-150, 4Au/CN150, 5Au/CN-150, and 6Au/CN-150 according to the y value.

2.1.4. Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 Binary Composites. The purchased Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ reagent and the prepared CN-150 sample were added to a beaker in the mass ratio of 5:95, then 1 M HCl solution (20 mL) was added to the beaker, and this mixture was subjected to ultrasonication for 1 h. After the operation of ultrasonication, the precipitation was left by removing most of the aqueous solution, followed by washing the precipitation with distilled water and removing the aqueous solution again. Finally, the precipitates were dried in a vacuum oven and ground, leading to the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample.

2.1.5. Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/Au/CN-150 Ternary Composites. Similar to the preparation of the binary composite of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 mentioned above, the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/Au/CN-150 ternary composite samples were obtained by assembling Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ onto 4Au/CN-150 using sonication for 1h.

2.1.6. Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 Ternary Composites. Similar to the preparation of the binary composite of y Au/CN-150 mentioned above, the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 ternary composite samples were prepared by in situ photodeposition of Au particles on the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/ CN-150 composites prepared above.

2.2. Characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer using Cu-K α radiation. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the composites and the corresponding X-ray energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were examined using a Sigma 300 and FEI Talos F200S and their accessories, respectively. UV - visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) data were collected using a PerkinElmer Lambda750 UV/vis spectrophotometer to the extent of 200 - 800 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using the C 1s peak at 248.8 eV as a reference for comparison. The photoelectrochemical tests were carried out at a Tung Wah electrochemical workstation (DH7001). The conditions of the test were a three-electrode system with a Pt electrode as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode, a dropcoated sample on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass to be tested as a working electrode, and an electrolyte of 0.5 M Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ solution.

The photocatalytic H$_{2}$ evolution experiments were carried out on a device (CEL-PAEM-D8, Bejing Aulight, China). The photocatalyst (10 mg) was suspended in 10 vol % triethanolamine solution (TEOA, 40 mL) and stirred continuously throughout the photocatalytic process. A 500 W Hg-lamp (CEL-S500-T5) and a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300-T3) with and without a 420 nm cutoff filter were utilized as UV-light source, simulated solar light, and visible light, respectively. A vacuum oil pump was used to remove the dissolved gas from the solution before light exposure, and then each experiment was exposed to light for 5 h and detected online by gas chromatography every half hour. The light intensity of the light source is detected using a CEL-NP2000 - 2(10)A light-intensity meter. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of hydrogen evolution was calculated after using the following equation: 26

2.3. Computational Methods. First-principles calculations were carried out using Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) software with the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method. 27 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parametrized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) was employed to describe the exchangecorrelation potential. 28 The heterojunction structure optimization and electronic structure calculation were carried out using a cutoff energy of 500 eV. A 2 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst - Pack γ -centered k -point grid was employed for Brillouin zone sampling. The convergence threshold of self-consistent filed iterations was set to 10 - 4 eV. To reproduce the experimental heterojunction structures, the single-layer g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and the (001) surface of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ were adopted, and the lattice mismatch was lower than 10%. The calculation of H * adsorption Gibbs freeenergy changes ( Δ G$_{H}$$_{*}$ ) of all reaction steps was obtained by the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method, 29 which was obtained from the following formula:

where Δ E$_{total}$ is the total energy calculated from DFT calculations, T is the room temperature which took 298.15 K, Δ S and Δ E$_{ZPE}$ are respectively the entropy change and zero-point energy calculated from vibrational frequencies for the adsorbed species, U is the potential for electrochemistry process, and e is the number of electrons transform in the step.

## 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Phase Formation Analysis of Composites. The modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ samples CNn have been successfully prepared by copolymerization of melamine (see Figure S1a ), with no significant change in the simple diffraction peak with increasing n value, which is alike to the results reported by Li et al. 30 The (001) and (002) peaks of the CNn samples correspond to the interlayer structural packing pattern of the tris -triazine unit and the interplanar stacking of the aromatic system, respectively. 31 Then, the assembly of different percentages of Au particles on the CN-150 sample resulted in a significant enhancement of the Au diffraction peak intensities with the increase of Au loading, such as the characteristic peaks of (111), (200), (220), and (311) ( Figure S1b ). Regarding Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, a diffraction peak at 2 θ of 6.5 ° corresponding to the (002) crystal plane of Ti$_{3}$AlC$_{2}$ appears as the most intense reflection with the other reflections much weakened or invisible, consistent with the exfoliation of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ layers along the c axis and confirming the two-dimensional nature for Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$. By comparing the diffractograms of Au/ Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 with Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150, 4Au/CN-150, CN-150, and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, we confirmed that Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 samples contain Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, CN-150, and Au components (see Figure 3 a).

Figures 3 b and S2 show the FTIR spectra of the above composite samples with the modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and yAu/CN150 composites for comparison, which reveal a common peak at 811 cm - 1 marked by a yellow box in all samples from the typical triazine ring in g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ structure, 32 confirming the presence of the graphitic carbon nitride phase in all of the composites. The region marked by the green box around 549 cm - 1 highlights that the spectra change arising from the interaction of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and Au with CN-150; this phenomenon is not quite the same as that reported in a number of literature. 21 , 22 , 33 , 34 Although no explanation is given in the literature, we speculate that it is caused by the low content of MXene in it. For our results, the two binary composites 4Au/ CN-150 and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 are distinctly different at ∼ 549 cm - 1 with respect to the intrinsic CN-150; moreover, Au significantly enhances the peak at 811 cm - 1 upon comparison, suggesting that Au has a strong delivering effect with CN150. 21 The most important comparison of the FTIR spectra of the ternary composites with those of CN-150 shows that there is still a peak at 549 cm - $^{1}$; it just appears to be less pronounced

compared to the FTIR spectra of the binary composites. This can be reasonably explained by the synthesis schematic in Figure 2 , where a significant portion of the gold is deposited on Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ rather than all on CN-150, which is a significant difference from that of the binary composite.

3.2. Morphological Analysis of Composites. The morphologies of the samples were examined by using SEM. Figure S3 shows the morphologies of CN-150, Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 samples, revealing CN-150 in a curled shape and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ in a multilayered organ shape. Figures 4 a and S3d show the morphology of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample. The EDS elemental analysis confirms that the Au particles were successfully loaded in the composites (see Figure S4 ). Although the multilayered Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ was not clearly seen in the SEM image of the ternary composite, the EDS elemental mapping of C, N, Ti, and Au ( Figure 4 ) indicate that the C and N elements are essentially uniformly distributed in the examined area, while the Ti elements are distributed in the most place of the examined area, confirming the presence of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ in the composite. The ratio of Ti:Au:C:N was analyzed

by EDS spectra in the microzone of the composite as 0.21:0.56:2.1:4 (see Figure 4 f).

The morphology of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample was further examined by using TEM, which illustrates that the gold particles are in nanometer as black/gray dots in Figures 5 and S5 on the reduction active sites along the surfaces of both CN150 and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$. 32 , 35 In a selected area of element mapping shown in Figure 5 , the middle area of the distribution maps of C and N elements showing much less C and N is exactly the place where the Ti elements are concentrated, confirming that the layered Ti$_{2}$C$_{3}$ particles sit on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ sheets.

3.3. XPS Analysis of Composites. The chemical states of the CN-150, 4Au/CN-150, and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 samples were characterized by XPS spectroscopy (see Figure 6 and Table S1 ). First, we focus on the high-resolution spectra of the C 1s contained in Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and CN-150 samples. In the C 1s high-resolution spectrum of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, four peaks can be analyzed at 281.6, 284.8, 286.5, and 288.7 eV, which correspond to C - Ti, C - C, C - O, and C  O, respectively (see Figure 6 a), 18 , 19 , 36 , 37 while the three C 1s peaks in CN-150 with small to large binding energies can be identified as C - C, C - N  C, and N - C  N, respectively. 18 , 19 Table S1 summarizes the positions and percentages of each element in the CN-150, 4Au/CN-150, and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 samples. From the difference in the number and position of the C 1s peaks of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and CN-150 compounds, it can be concluded that the C in Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ is mainly in the form of a C - C single bond, which is consistent with the crystal structure of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ consisting of C - C layers, while in CN-150, C elements mainly present in the form of N - C  N, matching the structure of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ consisting of triazine or heptazine rings, which has a large number of N - C  C bonds. 31

Second, we examined the high-resolution spectra of C 1s of binary composites composed of CN-150 and Au or Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$. From the variation of the relative percentages of the individual C 1s peaks, it can be concluded that the presence of Au causes a decrease of N - C  N and an increase of C - N  C and C - C in the binary composites. This can be explained by the binding site of Au being on N - C  N. However, the complexation of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ with CN-150 basically did not change the relative occupancy of the individual C 1s peaks of CN-150 except for the addition of a C 1s peak of C - Ti. Finally, we found that the C 1s high-resolution spectra in the ternary composites with 4Au/CN-150 both have C - C as the absolute majority, but the other two peaks in the ternary composites are changed relative to those of 4Au/CN-150 due to the effect of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$.

In the N 1s high-resolution spectra of CN-150, four peaks were analyzed at 398.7, 400.0, 401.2, and 404.5 eV, corresponding to C - N  C, N-(C)$_{3}$, C - N - H, and charging effects in heterocycles, respectively (see Figure 6 b). 18 , 22 Comparing CN-150 with Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150, it is found that they both mainly contain the same percentage of C - N  C peaks, except that Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ changes the percentage of N-(C)$_{3}$ and C - N - H peaks. Next, the analysis of Au-contained binary and ternary composites shows that the C - N  C peak does increase to some extent. This is in line with the trend of the peak observed in comparison to the C 1s peak of 286.5 eV. In addition, by comparing the N 1s peak out at ∼ 404.5 eV, it can be concluded that Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ enhances the charging effect of the heterocyclic compound, while Au attenuates this effect. Combined with the results of C 1s analysis, it can be concluded that the photodeposition of Au breaks the N - C  N bond.

In the high-resolution spectrum of Ti 2p, six peaks at 454.7, 456.0, 458.7, 460.4, 461.7, and 464.6 eV correspond to Ti - C

2p$_{3/2}$, Ti-X 2p$_{3/2}$, Ti - O 2p$_{3/2}$, Ti - C 2p$_{1/2}$, Ti-X 2p$_{1/2}$, and Ti - O 2p$_{1/2}$, respectively (see Figure 6 c). 20 , 22 , 38 However, due to the difficulty in confirming the different chemical energy shifts that may result from the large variety of end groups on the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ surface, the exact valence of Ti has not been given in our work and in numerous literatures. Comparing the highresolution spectra of C 1s and N 1s before and after the complexation with Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and CN-150 showing small differences in their relative percentages in the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p, we notice an apparent change in the relative percentages of peaks of different Ti 2p orbitals. This can be concluded that the interaction between the two components is mainly coupled through Ti. In the ternary composite, the peak of Ti-X is too small to be fingered, indicating that the original surface end groups of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ have been minimized in the ternary composites. It is consistent with the fact that no significant C - Ti peak is detected in the C 1s spectrum in the ternary composites.

In the high-resolution spectrum of Au 4f of 4Au/CN-150 and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150, the two peaks analyzed at ∼ 83.5 and

∼ 87.2 eV correspond to 4f$_{7/2}$ and 4f$_{5/2}$, respectively (see Figure 6 d). 6 The Au 4f spectrum is relatively simple. The Au is mainly coupled directly to CN-150, so the percentages of these two peaks varied very little in 4Au/CN-150 and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN150. Based on the position of the two characteristic peaks of Au 4f and the fixed difference of 3.7 eV, it can be determined that the gold has a zero chemical valence. 6

3.4. Photocatalytic Performance. The photocatalytic HER was tested for 5 h for each reaction under different types of light irradiation with TEOA at a volume concentration of 10% as a sacrificial agent. Figure 7 a shows that the hydrogen evolution rates of the CNn samples under UV irradiation and simulated solar irradiation follow the same trend, with the rate of hydrogen production increasing and then decreasing as x increases monotonically. The best hydrogen evolution performance was detected on the CN-150 sample. Li et al. reported that the hydrogen evolution rate of the CN modified with malonamide sample CBCN-30 was 3.4 times higher than that of the unmodified CN sample. 30 Here, the hydrogen evolution rates of the CN-150 samples under UV and

simulated sunlight irradiation are 456.3 and 17.6 μ mol/h/g, which are 2.2 and 1.1 times higher than those of the CN-0 samples under the corresponding same lights, respectively. It is noteworthy that the CNn series samples did not have detectable hydrogen evolution performance under visible light illumination in the absence of a cocatalyst, which is consistent with many findings in the literature. For example, the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ reported by Zou et al. cannot produce hydrogen under visible light illumination and requires the cocatalyst Pt for hydrogen evolution. 39

Then, the hydrogen evolution performance of the sample Au/CN-150 is higher than that of the sample CN-150, which can be attributed to the presence of gold well enhancing the light absorption properties and providing more photocatalytic active sites. 40 The hydrogen evolution rates of 4Au/CN-150 samples under UV and simulated sunlight illumination conditions were 774.4 and 735.8 μ mol/h/g, which were 1.7 and 41.8 times higher than those of CN-150 samples, respectively. Of particular note is that 4Au/CN-150 presents a hydrogen evolution rate of 20.2 μ mol/h/g under visible illumination, in great contrast with CN-150 that has no detectable hydrogen evolution rate under visible illumination (see Figure 7 b).

Figure 7 c shows the results of the photocatalytic performance of the H$_{2}$ evolution of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 ternary composite compared with the other samples. From the observation of the variation of hydrogen evolution rates of different photocatalysts under visible illumination, it can be concluded that Au particles are the key component contributing to the visible photocatalytic performance of the composite, and the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ has a weak function in enhancing the generalizable light response of the parent material but improves the overall performance, particularly under visible light for the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 ternary composite. Moreover, a bridging role of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ in enhancement of the photocatalytic performance can also be deduced. The hydrogen evolution rate of the ternary composite is 122.1 μ mol/h/g under visible light, which is a remarkable improvement from nothing relative to CN-0 and CN-150. The hydrogen evolution performance of

different compositions of photocatalysis under simulated solar illumination varies greatly, and it is clear that the ternary photocatalyst is superior to the binary photocatalyst and singlecomponent photocatalyst. 41 From the hydrogen evolution rates of different photocatalysts under UV illumination, the same conclusion can be deduced as that from the data under simulated solar illumination.

Figure 7 d gives the relationship between the AQY of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample under different wavelengths of light and the absorption spectrum. The AQY decreases with the weakening of the intrinsic absorbance properties of Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/ CN-150 samples, where the absorption peaks of Au particles play a lower role in the conversion of visible light into hydrogen. 6 The AQYs at 380, 400, 420, and 550 nm are 4.18, 2.19, 0.85, and 0.04%, respectively (see Table S2 ). In our experiments, we also tried filters larger than 550 nm, e.g., 600 nm, whose hydrogen evolution rates are extremely low and cannot be used to calculate AQY.

The photostability of photocatalysts has always been an important issue for practical applications. For example, black TiO$_{2}$ 42 and solid solution (Ga$_{1}$$_{-}$$_{x}$Zn$_{x}$)(N$_{1}$$_{-}$$_{x}$O$_{x}$) 43 verified their stability as photocatalysts by 100 and 35 h cycling experiments, respectively. However, no long-time cycling experiments have been reported in the photostability studies of MXenecontaining photocatalysts. Here, we conducted the first longtime cycling experiments on the MXene-containing material of an Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 composite sample (see Figure 7 e), which was exposed to the simulated sunlight for up to 120 h. Although the experiments showed that the rate of hydrogen evolution gradually decreases with the cumulative increase of light time, the addition of the TEOA at the right time can slow down the rate of decrease and regenerate the activity to some extent. After 120 h, the hydrogen evolution rate remained at ∼ 82% of the original value, which indicates that the composite photocatalyst has superb photostability. In particular, it should be noted that the results of the photostability testing experiments obtained for the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample under the same experimental conditions indicate poorer photostability (see Figure S6 ). This also indicates that Au in Au/

Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 plays an important role in enhancing the stability of the composite.

Table 1 summarizes the photocatalytic performances of the previously studied composites containing Ti-Mxene and gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ in the HER, for which the sacrificial agents used in the photocatalytic reactions are TEOA solutions with different concentrations. Here, the ratio of the hydrogen evolution rate of the composites to that of intrinsic g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was used to evaluate the effect of the composite strategy. Under the simulated solar illumination, the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample enhanced the hydrogen evolution rate by 99.8 times relative to g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, which is higher than the enhanced times of any other composites under the same photocatalytic conditions. 19 , 20 , 33 , 44 - 46 Since there is no observable hydrogen production activity on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and CN-150 under visible light, it is not possible to calculate the enhancement ratio of the composites relative to g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ under visible light. However, the enhancement ratio of the hydrogen production rate of Au/ Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 to that of 4Au/CN-150 may be calculated to be 6.0 under visible light, which is still a relatively high enhancement multiple. Under UV illumination, the enhancement multiple of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 composite relative to g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ was 2.1. Based on the results of the high enhancement multiplier of Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 relative to the photocatalytic performance of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, we can conclude that the strategy of integrating Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, Au, and CN-150 into a composite photocatalyst is successful and excellent. It should also be noted that the absolute values of the hydrogen evolution rates and the AQY@ 420 nm of the photocatalysts in this paper are still moderate compared with those of similar composites, which indicates that subsequent studies can be deepened in the preparation of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ to further enhance the photocatalytic activity.

3.5. Photocatalytic Mechanism. In order to gain insight into the photocatalytic mechanism of Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150, the absorbance properties, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance have been recorded on Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 as well as CN-150, Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150, and 4Au/CN-150 for comparison. The absorbance properties were characterized by DRS, which showed that the absorption edges of the four samples were nearly identical except for the light absorption capacities in the region from 450 to 750 ( Figure 8 a). Compared with CN-150, the absorption capacity of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 increased significantly, while the binary and ternary composites containing Au had stronger absorption performance within the visible light range. This is ascribed to the Au particles with a representative characteristic absorption peak in the range of 500 - 650 nm, which has been observed in many literatures. 6 , 48 - 52 The DRS data were processed by the Tauc formula, 53 , 54 and the bandgaps of the CN-150, Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150, 4Au/CN-150, and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 samples are 2.73, 2.73, 2.67, and 2.67 eV, respectively (see Figure 8 b). Through comparing the bandgaps of the four samples, it can be inferred that Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ has almost no effect on the variation of the bandgap, while Au has a weak effect on the bandgap. This can be attributed to the MXene material being a conductor, while the Au particles are conductors but have visible absorption capability, which leads to a weak effect on the bandgap.

The above four samples were further characterized using photocurrent and electrochemical impedance tests ( Figure 8 c,d). The results show that the ternary composite has significantly enhanced photoresponsiveness relative to the binary composite, while the CN-150 has the weakest photoresponsiveness. This is actually positively correlated with the above photocatalytic performance of hydrogen evolution. 55 The electrochemical impedance tests ( Figure 8 d) indicate that the composite can significantly reduce the

The yellow and cyan areas denote electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. (c) Free-energy diagram of HER processing on a g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ heterojunction.

interfacial resistance, and among these four samples, the ternary composite material has the smallest interfacial resistance. Based on the combined experimental results of photocurrent and electrochemical impedance, it can be inferred that Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 could have the best photocatalytic performance among CN-150, 4Au/CN-150, Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/ CN-150, and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 samples, which is consistent with the photocatalytic results above.

At the next stage, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was used to uncover the inherent mechanism of improved photocatalytic properties for Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 heterojunction from the electron transfer pathways. To identify the electrons' transfer pathway, the charge density differences ( Δ ρ ) were calculated for the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/gC$_{3}$N$_{4}$ heterojunctions. 56 , 57 As shown in Figure 9 a,b, the cyan areas for charge accumulation were obviously distributed on the surfaces of both Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, while the yellow areas for charge depletion were occupied by the interface of the heterojunctions. This phenomenon indicates that stronger covalent bonds are formed between Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ by the formation of Ti - C or Ti - N bonds. This is also the reason the heterojunction structures were quite stable, and it explains to some extent the disappearance of the end-group Ti-X peaks in the ternary composite in Figure 6 c as well. After the Au nanoparticles are loaded on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ heterojunction surface, the electrons further transfer to Au particles, which could provide more active reaction sites for the H$_{2}$ evolution process. The free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( Δ G$_{H}$ * ) on different catalyst surfaces of g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, and Au/ Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ heterostructures is shown in Figure 9 c. The calculated Δ G$_{H}$ * on the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$, g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, and Au/ Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ were - 1.86, - 0.87, and 0.56 eV, respectively.

Thus, the Δ G$_{H}$ * of Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ is closer to the thermoneutral state, which indicates that both the fast proton transfer and rapid hydrogen release process occurred on Au/ Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ heterostructures. The results of the previous photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and cycling experiments indicate that Au plays an important role in the composites for enhancement of hydrogen evolution performance and photostability. Further, theoretical calculations show that the figures of merit of Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and Au/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ are 3.96 and 5.93 eV, respectively (see Figure S7 ). The smaller figure of merit implies that the surface electrons are more likely to break free and transfer from the surface to the water molecules. This confirms from theoretical calculations that the role of gold in the composites is to degrade the work function of the composites.

Hence, based on the above analysis, we propose a model for the photocatalytic mechanism of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 composite (see Figure 9 d). The essence is that electrons, whether photogenerated or hot, react with protons in the TEOA solution in a reduction reaction to obtain hydrogen; photogenerated holes react with TEOA in an oxidation reaction to produce water and carbon dioxide. Using the Xabsolute electronegativity formula, 58 , 59 we obtained the conduction band and valence band potentials of CN-150 as - 1.12 and 1.56 V, respectively. The hot electrons of Au are injected into the modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and transferred to Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ simultaneously along with the photogenerated electrons of the modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and then further transferred to Au, forming a photogenerated electron transfer channel of Au and CN-150 → Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ → Au within the composite. In this electron transfer channel, we can clearly see that the electrons in the whole composite material originate from two important constituents,

Figure 10. H$_{2}$ evolution rates of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample in pure water under (a) simulated sunlight and (b) UV-light irradiation.

CN-150 and some Au$_{C}$ particles, and are then transferred to some Au$_{T}$ particles to bind with protons through Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, which plays a role similar to that of a solid-state electron moderator. Here, the difference between Au$_{C}$ and Au$_{T}$ is that Au$_{C}$ is in direct contact with CN-150 while Au$_{T}$ is in direct contact with Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$; this can be evidenced by Figure 5 . This electron transfer channel realizes the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (oxidation reaction on CN-150; reduction reaction on Au$_{T}$), which contributes to the synergistic improvement of the charge separation efficiency, resulting in a several-fold improvement of the photocatalytic performance with respect to pristine CN-0. It is very interesting to note that the hydrogen evolution rate of our prepared Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/Au/CN150 ternary composites under simulated sunlight is much less than that of Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 not to mention that it is lower than that of 4Au/CN-150 and only higher than that of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/ CN-150 and the noncomposite (see Figure S8 ). This phenomenon fully showed that the bridging effect of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ between Au and CN-150 plays a key role in the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. Although a similar photocatalytic mechanism was proposed in the g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ - Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ - Pt composite, 20 a notable difference in our work is that the Au particles, in addition to contributing to the spatial segregation of charges, also enhance the visible light-absorbing properties and photocatalytic activity of the composite through providing hot electrons by the surface plasmon resonance effect. 60 , 61 Moreover, the Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ MXene acts as a bridging electron trap to collect photogenerated electrons, which could avoid the oxidation of MXene, being the important reason for realizing the long-time stable hydrogen evolution here.

Finally, the synergistic effect of Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 is summarized here. At first, the basic roles of Au, CN-150, and Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ should be clarified. There are two basic roles of Au, one is Au$_{C}$ to generate hot electrons, and the other is Au$_{T}$ to act as a photocatalytic active site. CN-150 also has two basic roles: one is that CN-150 is the main component and therefore plays the role of the carrier of the composite material, and the other role is to generate photogenerated electrons and holes by light excitation. The basic role of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ is to favor charge transfer due to its high electrical conductivity. When the above three components form a composite material, based on their basic roles, new roles are created, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic performance, which is the so-called synergistic effect. For example, theoretical calculations show that Au reduces the work function of composites, and diffuse reflectance results show that Au enhances the light-absorbing properties of composites. Although CN-150 can receive hot electrons from Au$_{C}$, oxidation reactions can also occur only at

CN-150 due to spatial separation of charges. The role of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ in composites is mainly to efficiently transfer electrons to Au$_{T}$, which is the role of a bridge, as mentioned in the article.

3.6. Water Splitting. Water splitting has been an important reaction in photocatalytic research. Based on the above findings, we put the optimal Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample in pure water to try the water splitting reaction. As shown in Figure 10 , the hydrogen production rates of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/ CN-150 sample under simulated sunlight and UV illumination were 4.1 and 33.6 μ mol/h/g, respectively. In fact, we also tested the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample under illumination above 420 nm. However, there is no detectable hydrogen signal. These results provide a new direction for further research of the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 sample to achieve high efficiency of the water splitting reaction under visible light illumination.

## 4. CONCLUSIONS

The ternary composite Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 was designed and fabricated, and its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates under UV, simulated sunlight, and visible illumination were improved by 2.1-, 99.8-, and ∞ -fold, respectively, relative to unmodified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$. This is a huge enhancement compared to other Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ photocatalysts of similar composition reported in the literature, which is mainly attributed to the spatial separation of photogenerated charges by Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ acting as a bridge between modified g-C$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and Au particles, the multifunctional property of Au. The role of Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ in assisting electron transfer in the composites and the role of Au in enhancing photocatalytic performance and photocatalytic stability are highlighted here. Such new synergistic effects in the Au/Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$/CN-150 composite photocatalyst are supported by photoelectrochemical tests, DFT calculations, and photocatalytic control experiments. Moreover, this ternary composite photocatalyst exhibits excellent sustained hydrogen evolution performance. Our work provides a practical strategy to enhance the visible light photocatalytic activity and improve the photostability of the MXene-containing photocatalyst. However, the complexity of the preparation process of this composite photocatalyst and the need for further simplification of the synthesis as well as its photostability still have room for improvement, and subsequent work can be devoted to solving these problems.
