## ABSTRACT

The study examined the transport behavior of the 2-aryl propionic acid (2-APA) chiral pharmaceutical enantiomers by means of a laboratory-scale saturated quartz sand column experiment. Four typical of 2-APA and their enantiomers were selected for the study under different types of chiral organic acids (COAs)-mediated effects. Differences in the transport of the 2-APA enantiomeric pairs have been identified in response to various pH, types of COAs, and enantiomeric structures of COAs. Redundancy analysis identified the factors responsible for the largest differences in transport of 2-APA enantiomeric pairs, while spectroscopic characterization and density function theory (DFT) studies elucidated the underlying mechanisms contributing to the differences in transport of enantiomeric pairs. Obvious correlations among homochirality or heterochirality between COAs and 2-APA enantiomeric pairs were observed for changes in the mobility of 2-APA. The results indicate widespread COAs significantly affect the transport behavior of chiral man-made chemicals, suggesting more attention is needed to fill the gap in the perception of the transport behavior of chiral compounds.

pharmacologically active compounds give optimal removal efficiencies at municipal WWTPs, the non-negligible rural improvised wastewater treatment measures still remain a source of ecological contamination with man-made compounds [2]. Most importantly, the removal of man-made compounds depends on their physicochemical properties (i. e . , solubility, hydrophobicity, and dissociative State). For example, carbamazepine, diclofenac, erythromycin, and metoprolol are poorly removed in conventional wastewater treatment processes [3]. However, neglected chiral pharmacologically active compounds (CPACs) often cause unintended ecology hazards [4]. It is common for CPACs to exist as enantiomers, which have similar physical and chemical properties [5], whilst differing in their biological properties (i.e . , distribution, metabolism, and excretion), as these processes (due to stereospecific interactions between the enantiomer and the biological system) usually favour one enantiomer over the other [1,6,7]. The CPACs enantiomers contribute to varying degrees of biotoxicity to microorganisms and ecosystems as well, with the potential risk of additional bacterial resistance genes [8,9]. Evidence is mounting some enantiomeric pairs have unique ecological effects among themselves. For instance, the 2-aryl propionic acid (2-APA) chiral pharmaceutical enantiomers potentially contribute significantly different toxicity effects to the aquatic models used in eco-toxicity studies [10,11].

Dedicated to the separation of chiral compounds, long-standing research has resulted in efficient techniques (i.e . , crystallisation, kinetic separation, chromatography, and membrane separation) that provide optimal separation rates [26 -28]. The essence of chromatographic and membrane separation techniques is the preferential transfer of an enantiomer via a chiral selector [28,29]. This depends primarily on the difference in Gibbs free energy ( Δ G θ ) between the enantiomer and the chiral selectant comprising the complex, also the difference in entropy ( Δ S θ ) and enthalpy ( Δ H θ ) contributions [27]. Another theory are stereo-specific interactions between the chiral recognition site and the enantiomers (i.e . , hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, Coulombic forces, van der Waals forces, and spatial site resistance effects) [30], responsible for different rates of enantiomeric diffusion. The chiral recognition site has a high affinity for one enantiomer and accelerates the transport of that enantiomer, a process is characteristic of the facilitated transport mechanism. Consequently, chiral selectants construct chiral-containing environments enable enantioselective transport. Whereas natural ecological environments are higher

dimensional chiral environments, the potential for stereoselective enantiomeric transport is ignored. Malic acid (MA) as well as tartaric acid (TA) derived from herbaceous and woody plants have been validated for their potential as chiral selective agents [29,30]. Studies revealed their low separation success rate (approximate 60%) does not allow for transmembrane transport by membrane technology [31]. Nevertheless, it supports the hypothesis that natural organic acids (NOAs) have the potential to stereoselectively influence the transport of different enantiomers.

Among microbial and fungal produced NOAs, which are rich in -OH and -COOH functional groups commonly found in environmental media (i.e . , surface water, groundwater, and soil solutions) [32 -34]. Chiral organic acids (COAs) are thought to influence inter-root and soil-forming processes and confirmed studies have shown COAs lead to variations in the surface charge properties of the soil [33]. Our study focuses more on the effect of different types and specific rotation of COAs on the transport of the enantiomers. Understanding the effect of COAs on the retention and release of 2-APA enantiomeric pair is essential for assessing their environmental fate and potential risks to groundwater safety.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Porous media and solution chemistry

Quartz sand cleaning protocol is available in S1 (Supplementary information, SI). The protocol for the use of the zeta potential of quartz sand is given in S2. The microscopic characteristics and surface morphology of the quartz sand were studied by scanning electron microscopes (Fig. S3, SEM, S-4800 Hitachi, Japan) and the elemental composition was determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The Bruno Emmett Taylor (BET) specific surface area and porosity of the quartz sand were measured using a surface area and porosity analyzer (Table S3 and Fig. S4, Micromeritics ASAP 2460, McMurtic Instruments, USA). We chose quartz sand with fewer pores as well as smaller pore sizes for our experiments to minimize misleading conclusions regarding stereoselective transport of enantiomers by uncontrolled pore filling.

Typical 2-APA enantiomers selected were IBF-R, IBF-S, KTF-R, KTFS, NPX-R, NPX-S, CRF-R, and CRF-S, which were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Network (Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Shanghai, P.R. China). The basic information (i.e . , relative molecular mass, molecular formula, molecular structure, dissociation constants (pKa), and the logarithm of octanol/water partition coefficient (logKow)) regarding the 2-APA is tabulated in Table S1. A stock solution of 1 g L GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$of 2-APA enantiomer in methanol (for CRF enantiomer, Fisher Chemical, Shanghai, China) or ultrapure water (for IBF, KTF, and NPX enantiomers) was prepared [37,38]. The stock solution was refrigerated at GLYPH<0> 20 · C for further test, maximizing the possibility of using all reagents the same day they were prepared (The longest reagent storage time did not exceed 12 h, column experiments were performed for approximately 3.5 h, and sorption experiment were performed for approximately 5 h). The 2-APA solution for each experiment was freshly prepared by separately diluting the parent concentrate into a series of background solutions (the tests involved pH conditions of 3 -9) containing 1 mM of different COAs, to obtain the working concentration of 10 mg L GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. Most of the relevant 2-APA concentrations in the environment are in the order of μ g L GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, whereas in pharmaceutical companies, hospital effluents, and traditional WWTPs it has been reported to be on the order of mg L GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$[2,3]. On the one hand, there are potentially high concentrations of 2-APA in certain specific environments. on the other hand, in this work we chose working concentrations

Column packing protocol is available in S3 according to the method used in our earlier study [35,36]. The total recovery (R, %) is calculated via the mass recovery protocol (S4) while the calculation of porosity is available in S5. The average porosity of the packed column was 0.41 while average pore volume (PV) was 7.3 mL.

An important class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 2-APAs have the same chiral center and differ from each other by only one substituent group [7,12]. Commonly used pharmaceuticals have anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity because of their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenases promote inflammation [13,14]. Reports revealed the therapeutic effects of 2-APA chiral pharmaceuticals lie almost entirely with their (S)-( + )-enantiomers, rather than (R)-(-)-enantiomers [14,15]. The enantiomer with the required biological activity should be given from a medical point of view to avoid unnecessary drug consumption and to minimise side effects. Despite (S)-( + )-ibuprofen (IBF-S) has been confirmed to be 160 times more active than (R)-(-)-ibuprofen (IBF-R), IBF and ketoprofen (KTF) are most often produced and consumed as racemic mixtures, due to the high cost of production and lengthy synthetic routes [16,17]. Manufacturing and dispensing as (S)-( + )-naproxen (NPX-S) only has been achieved in some developed countries, due to concerns about the toxicity of (R)-(-)-naproxen (NPX-R) [10,15]. NPX-R is also more toxic to bacteria community than NPX-S [18,19], while (S)-( + )-carprofen (CRF-S) exhibits considerably higher sensitivity to plankton than (R)-(-)-carprofen (CRF-R) [20, 21]. Research on 2-APA enantiomeric pairs has previously only addressed differentiation, detection, and toxology [22 -25], leaving a large knowledge gap regarding the transport behaviour of 2-APA. Most reports tegarding the transport and fate of 2-APA fail to distinguish between their enantiomeric pairs. The role of chirality in the transport and retention of 2-APA enantiomeric pairs is often disregarded.

that conveniently show more clearly the differences in transport caused by stereoselectivity. Preliminary tests using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Ultimate 3000, Dionex) on the 2-APA compounds exhibited no significant fluctuations over a 7-day period, so the solution was considered stable and did not degrade significantly during the column experiments.

Typically, 2-APA have only one dissociation constant and are present in the form of neutral molecules and anions [10,25]. The fraction of various forms of 2-APA for a given pH is estimated by the Eq. 1 (Eq. (1)) [42], consequences shown in Fig. S2.

The options of COAs were L-(-)-malic acid (MA-L), D-( + )-malic acid (MA-D), D-(-)-tartaric acid (TA-D), L-( + )-tartaric acid (TA-L), L(-)-camphoric acid (CA-L), and D-( + )-camphoric acid (CA-D) (Purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Network). These COAs are ubiquitous in various environmental media and are derived from fruit, fruit epidermis, as well as extractions and secretions of woody plants [39 -41]. The COAs were chosen to investigate the effect of the different numbers of central carbon atoms of the COAs on the transport of the 2-APA. Namely, MA possesses one central carbon atom, while CA and TA possess two central carbon atoms (Table S2)[1, 14, 31].

## 2.2. Sorption and transport models

Protocols for sorption experiment are available in S6. Sorption kinetic models, isotherm models, and thermodynamic models are provided to investigate the sorption mechanism of enantiomer on sand (S5). All sorption experiments were performed three times for each condition and the data reported are the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.).

The transport model is solved numerically by means of the STANMOD-encoded non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. The dimensionless form of the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) with two-site non-equilibrium transport model (TSM) was used to simulate the transport of 2-APA [43]. Longitudinal dispersion coefficients (D) were fitted by breakthrough curves (BTCs) for conservative tracers (NaNO$_{3}$) using a one-dimensional steady-state advection-dispersion equation. It is assumed the D value of the 2-APA in the column is the same as that of the tracer [44]. Hence, parameters (i.e . , the retardation factors (R), the fraction of instantaneous retardation to the total retardation ( β ), and the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ( ω )) were obtained by fitting the BTCs to the 2-APA respectively while detailes are available in S7.

## 2.3. Spectroscopic characterization

Protocols for characterisation techniques are available in S8.

## 2.4. Quantum chemistry calculations

The Gaussian 09 package (DFT/B3LYP/6 -31 ++ G**) implements all quantum chemistry studies. The wave function-based analysis of weak interactions, frontier molecular orbitals, and chelation mechanisms was implemented by the Multiwfn 3.8 (dev) code [45]. Structure and isosurface diagrams are plotted by Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) 1.9.3 based on Multiwfn ' s data files [46]. The electrostatic potential maps (ESP) and interaction region indicator (IRI) were obtained and displayed via the Multiwfn and VMD based on the results of the calculations mentioned above [47,48].

## 3.1. COAs and pH conditions affect the transport of 2-APA enantiomeric pairs

In general, the pH conditions provide the most significant effect on the transport of solutes, which involves the alteration of the surface charge of solutes [44]. Since altered pH affect the charge of solutes, which depends on the dissociation constant, this drives variation in the transport of the solute via electrostatic interactions [35]. The 2-APA enantiomeric pairs were mainly in molecular form at pH = 3, whereas with increasing pH, the 2-APA enantiomers were predominantly in anionic form [10]. In contrast, the negative charge on the surface of the quartz sand raised with increasing pH (Table 1), accompanied by the deprotonation of the enantiomers, exacerbating the electrostatic repulsion between the enantiomers and the sand. As shown in Fig. 1a-h, pH increases greatly facilitate the transport of the 2-APA by affecting the degree of dissociation, the properties of the quartz surface, and hydrogen bonding, among other mechanisms. For the IBF enantiomeric pairs, the increased average recovery could reach approximately 65.00% (Table 2), compared to 21.37% for KTF, 75.38% for NPX, and 97.22% for CRF (Table S4 -6). Differences in transport of solution depend not only on electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic forces also exhibited to provide a potential influence regarding the sorption behaviour of solutes with quartz sand [49]. The larger the logKow, the more hydrophobic the solute [50]. As the solution conditions become more acidic, the electrostatic repulsion would be significantly weakened along with the protonation of the solute. Therefore, CRF exhibited the highest affinity for quartz sand under strongly acidic conditions, followed by IBF, NPX, and KTF, when hydrophobic forces are dominant the sorption process. The higher affinity of the quartz sand increased the retention of the enantiomer in the column and the retardation factor (R) solved by the partial differential equation provided the valuable numerical explanation. At pH three, CRF exhibited the greatest R ( > 16), followed by NPX, IBF, and KTF (Table S4-S6). The variations of pH did not drive chiral interactions nor promote potentially stereoselective reactions.

The inclusion of COAs altered the transport of enantiomeric pair showing observable differences (Fig. 2). The introduction of COAs occupies available sites on the surface of the quartz sand, thus triggering an sorption competition effect and facilitating the transport of

enantiomeric pair [44,50]. The complexation of COAs with solutes during this process cannot be ignored and is an important finding. Our initial study found the addition of L-(-)-malic acid (MA-L) promoted the transport of the IBF enantiomer at pH three, whereas a different degree of promotion was observed for the enantiomeric pairs (Fig. 2). An exciting phenomenon and to verify the generality of this conclusion, KTF, NPX, and CRF have been tested and draw similar conclusions. It is suspected that there is a neglected force which alters the enantiomer ' s ability to adsorb on the surface of the sand. Therefore, to explore the sorption of enantiomeric pairs on sand, the same experimental conditions were re-produced to reveal differences in the sorption capacity of the enantiomers on the quartz surface. Fig. S8-9 and Fig. 3 provide the experimental results of the sorption and Table S7-S9 provide the calculation parameters. Consequences revealed MA-L has the stereoselective effect on the sorption capacity of the 2-APA enantiomer on sand. Comparing qe(exp) and qe(cal), MA-L shifted different enrichment of the enantiomeric pairs on sand, with enantiomer-S was less enriched than enantiomer-R. However, this effect does not vary the primary sorption mechanism. The sorption kinetics regarding the sorption of enantiomeric pair on sand still satisfy the pseudo second order while the sorption isotherm is closer to the Langmuir. The Gibbs free energy indicates the sorption process is spontaneous, the entropy change reveals the sorption process is a heat sorption reaction, and the enthalpy change reveals the sorption of the 2-APA increases the randomness of the solid-liquid interface during reaction process [36,51]. Additionally, the same experimental conditions were carried out to determine the zeta potential changes on the quartz sand surface and the results are provided in Table S10. The surprising finding is the zeta potential of the quartz sand surface also has some differences due to the differences in the sorption capacity of the enantiomers to the quarta sand, where the quartz sand adsorbed with CRF exhibits a larger zeta potential difference due to the larger difference in sorption capacity of CRF.

The transport behaviour of the IBF was regularised when an attempt was made to vary the MA enantiomers, with MA-D, MA-rac, and mixed

MA (i.e . , MA (L: 25%, D: 75%) and MA (L: 75%, D: 25%)) being added in turn. The mobility of the IBF was also promoted when MA-D was added, while the mobility of IBF-R was significantly higher than that of IBF-S. The addition of MA (L: 25%, D: 75%) showed similar results, however, the promoted mobility of IBF-R was lower than that of IBF-R when MA-D was added. A similar phenomenon occurs when MA (L: 75%, D: 25%) is used as a background solution. Uniquely, MA-rac did not trigger stereoselective enrichment of any 2-APA enantiomeric pairs, which is thought to be the racemic mixture is not a single compound thus does not trigger the unique chiral response between enantiomers. We observed differences in the roles of homochirality and heterochirality. That is, IBF-R and MA-L are homochiral compounds, and the binding capacity between them is stronger than between IBF-R and MA-D, and vice versa. We believe heterochirality compounds are more likely to form cages or rings between them thus creating greater spatial sitebarrier repulsion (discussed in Section 2.4), which leads to the conclusion that the binding between homochirality is easier, and thus homochiral compounds would be more likely to be retained in the column. Also, KTF, NPX, and CRF were experimentally validated to ensure homogeneity of conclusions. These enantiomeric pairs also revealed similar conclusions, as could also be observed in fitting parameters of TSM model, i.e . , the retardation factors (R), fraction of instantaneous retardation to the total retardation ( β ), and dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ( ω ) (Table 2, S4-S6). The R value of IBF-R was 14.920, β was 0.113, and ω was 0.139 when the background solution was MA-L, while these values were 12.070, 0.100, and 0.090 respectively when the background solution was MA-D. When the background solution was MAL, the R value of IBF-S was 12.030, β was 0.099, and ω was 0.089; while when the background solution was MA-D, these values were 15.220, 0.114, and 0.144. The variation in the fitted parameters of the TSM model for enantiomeric pairs provides convincing evidence for the heterogeneity of chiral compounds during transport.

We further investigated the role of coupled effects of COAs and different pH conditions on the transport of enantiomeric pair (Fig. S6).

Differences in the recovery of transport of 2-aryl propionic acid chiral pharmaceutical enantiomers under different environmental conditions (a), redundancy analysis on the differences in the recovery of enantiomers by different environmental conditions (b), and graphical representation of the effect of COAs on the sorption of 2-APA enantiomers on the surface of quartz sand (c).

The difference in enrichment of 2-APA on the surface of the sand was significantly reduced when the pH was more than three. When pH is three however, COAs molecules are subjected to double electric layer (EDL) repulsion during their proximity to 2-APA enantiomer molecules, which exhibit a mutual repulsion effect. Assuming the solutes (for all enantiomers of COAs and 2-APA) are subjected to the same hydrophobic forces, there is different weak interactions between the enantiomeric molecules of COAs and 2-APA due to conformational differences. This is manifested by stronger interactions between molecules with the homochiral structure and vice versa. As the pH increases, deprotonation is enhanced and COAs as well as 2-APA exhibit greater negative charges, leading to increased EDL repulsion and more difficult intermolecular approach. Meanwhile, hydrogen bonding is subsequently weakened and the aggregation of COAs with 2-APA enantiomers is weaker. It means the differences due to chiral interactions are not enough to cancel out the

electrostatic force, but could balance or even beyond the hydrophobic force. It is believed that the effect of mobility due to chiral differences is a relatively weak influence [52,53]. This influence does not alter the sorption process and is potentially subject to forces that are not limited to electrostatic action.

It is necessary to explore the effect of different COAs on the transport behaviour of enantiomeric pairs. Chiral separation that chiral substrates containing different central carbon atoms trigger more precise or diametrically opposed separation or purification effect, depending on the homochirality (close specific rotation) or heterochirality of the substrate and the solute to be separated [10,54,55]. Compounds with more central carbon atoms may have multiple spin properties at the same time. TA and CA were used as background solutions to probe their potential roles on the transport of the 2-APA. It is difficult to distinguish background solutions of substrates containing more central carbon atoms, as the

Journal of Hazardous Materials 468 (2024) 133824 Xu et al.

increased number of central carbon atoms means more absolute configurations of the enantiomer would exist. TA-D, TA-L, CA-L, and CA-D were used as background solutions to examine their effects on the transport of the 2-APA. The facilitation effect of TA and CA enantiomers on the transport of the 2-APA was still present and the difference in facilitation between the different enantiomers was also present (Fig. S7). TA-D and CA-L exhibited greater transport-promoting effects, compared to 2-APA enantiomer-R. For biomedical enantiomeric nomenclature, L and D do not represent their spin properties [13,16], so TA-D and CA-L actually have the same spin properties relative to MA-L. The same conclusion is shown for COAs containing different numbers of central carbon atoms. When these COAs were used as background solutions, they promoted the mobility of the 2-APA enantiomeric pairs and differentially promote the different enantiomers separately.

Compared to MA-L, TA-D and CA-L have a slightly reduced ability to facilitate the transport of enantiomers with homochirality. It can be seen from the recoveries of IBF enantiomers when the background solution was MA-L and pH was three, the recoveries of IBF-R and IBF-S were 0.626 and 0.853, respectively. Whereas the recoveries of IBF-R and IBF-S were 0.621 and 0.733 when the background solution was TA-D, as well as 0.627 and 0.679 when the background solution was CA-L, respectively. It is considered the strength of the facilitation effect of COAs on solute mobility is related to the chemical properties of COAs. MA and TA share similar groups, with MA containing two carboxyl groups and an alcoholic hydroxyl group and TA containing two carboxyl groups and two alcoholic hydroxyl groups [56]. The higher the number of carboxyl groups the more acidic they are; the alcoholic hydroxyl groups do not exhibit acidity. In contrast, CA contains a carboxyl group and a cyclooctyl group, which gives it a stable structure and less acidic [57]. The oxy-functional group significantly affects the affinity of the COAs on the quartz [49,58,59], thus attenuating the competing sorption effects of the different 2-APA enantiomeric pairs. However, this also does not explain the differences in transport behaviour of different enantiomers. Another suggestion is acidic and oxygen-containing functional groups affect the weak interaction forces between COAs and 2-APA enantiomers (i.e . , hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, van der Waals forces, space-site blocking interactions, etc.), thus affecting the deposition of 2-APA enantiomers on the quartz [60 -62]. This involves the connection between different chiral compounds and the interactions are not always the same between different chiral structures.

## 3.2. Spectroscopic analysis

Multiple spectroscopic characterizations (i.e . , 3D-EEM, XPS, and FTIR) were performed to verify the sorption mechanism of effect of COAs enantiomeric pair addition on the 2-APA enantiomeric pair on the quartz, respectively. The spectroscopic experiments were carried out with the example background solution of MA-L also at pH three. 3D-EEM spectra of IBF enantiomers before and after sorption on the quartz sand under the influence of MA-L are provided in Fig. S10a. The significant weakening of IBF-R in the excitation wavelength region of 350 -450 nm implies more sorption capacity of IBF-R on the quartz while IBF-S exhibits more wave peaks in this region. XPS was used to verify the structural variation of the functional group before and after sorption of the 2-APA enantiomeric pair (Fig. 4a-b, Fig. S10 b-c). The characterization of the different IBF enantiomers reveals only quantitative variation in the different functional groups and does not involve significant chemical variation. It implied the interaction of COAs with the 2-APA enantiomeric pair did not shift the sorption mechanism of these enantiomeric pair on the quartz sand. And the involved quartz affinity effects did not produce significant chemical effects [63,64]. The same results were observed in the XPS spectra of KTF, NPX, and CRF, respectively (Fig. S11-13). The variation of the oxy-functional groups (mainly for carboxyl group) during the sorption process still dominates, and this variation effect exhibits different degrees in the different enantiomers. FT-IR spectroscopy provided the same results as XPS given (Fig. 4c and

Fig. S15a-c). The study provides both XPS and FT-IR spectra of MA-L adsorbed on the quartz sand (Fig. S14 and Fig. S15d). Despite only a small amount of MA-L was adsorbed on the quartz, the chiral effect triggered by these MA-L regarding the difference in transport of the 2-APA is not negligible.

Several spectroscopic experiments were also performed to determine the structural effects of MA-L addition on the enantiomeric pair, as well as the potential interaction forces. No significant variation was observed in UV -vis after the addition of MA-L, conversely, CDs provided appreciable chromophore variation (Fig. 4d-e). The peaks in the 200 cm GLYPH<0> 1 and 210 -230 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$region of the chromophore are attributed to the 1B and 1La transitions [65,66]. Corresponding to the former leap band, the intensity of the latter leap band is more pronounced [60]. After the addition of MA-L, the change of the chromophore signal was obvious and the enhancement of the chromophore corresponds to the energy leap in the π -structure, reflecting the significant interaction differences between MA-L and the different enantiomers of IBF [67], leading to the appearance of complexes of different orders of magnitude. This phenomenon was observed in other involved 2-APA (Fig. S16-17), but the energy intensity of the leap was different for different 2-APA.

## 3.3. Mechanism investigation

The difference in recovery ( Δ R ) between 2-APA enantiomer-R and enantiomer-S was calculated according to S9 Eq. (22) and results listed in Fig. 5a. Intuitive differences in transport behaviour of enantiomers observed in IBF as well as in NPX, with MA-L and MA-D providing the largest differences in enantiomeric Δ R , 22.59% (pH3 + MA-L) and 24.12% (pH3 + MA-D) for IBF enantiomeric pair and 12.72% (pH3 + MA-L) and 11.66% (pH3 + MA-D) for NPX, respectively. In contrast, KTF enantiomeric pairs exhibited the least Δ R among the 2APA, which is thought to be due to the physicochemical properties of KTF. Compared to other 2-APA, KTF exhibited a higher hydrophilicity significantly weakening the sorption of KTF on the quartz. Furthermore, the ketone group of KTF reduces its contact with COAs, thus attenuating the weak interaction difference brought about by the chiral interaction between COAs and 2-APA enantiomeric pairs. As for CRF, significant differences ( Δ R = 9.73% (pH3 + MA-L) and 12.55% (pH3 + MA-D)) in transport behaviour of the enantiomers observed as well. Redundancy analysis was employed to reveal the most significant factors influencing the differences in transport behaviour of 2-APA enantiomeric pairs (Fig. 5b and Table S10). The first component provided 66.26% of the explanation and the second component provided 19.23% of the explanation. The condition regarding addition of COAs fell in the first quadrant, which meant the addition of COAs was significantly and positively correlated with the difference in transport behaviour of the 2-APA enantiomeric pairs. The difference in specific rotation between COAs and 2-APA enantiomers (relative specific rotation) fell in the fourth quadrant, revealing the greater the difference in specific rotation between the added COAs and the target solute enantiomers, the stronger the difference in transport of the enantiomeric pair. In contrast, the number of central carbon atoms of COAs fell in the second and third quadrant with respect to pH conditions, which meant the higher the number of central carbon atoms of COAs and the higher the pH, the smaller the transport difference between the enantiomeric pairs of the target solute.

It is suggested that the facilitation of the transport behaviour of COAs towards the 2-APA enantiomeric pair is due to the competitive sorption relationship between COAs and 2-APA enantiomers on the quartz (Fig. 5c). The addition of COAs occupied the available sorption sites on the quartz surface, while COAs generated a series of weak interactions with the 2-APA enantiomeric pairs, which triggered additional retention of these hydrophobic compounds in the column. The weak interaction between COAs and 2-APA enantiomers exhibited stereoselective recognition for different enantiomers, resulting in varying differences in sorption capacity, leading to different mobility of the enantiomeric

## 3.4. DFT calculations

Fig. 6 revealed the weak interactions between the IBF and the MA enantiomers, mainly hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and spatial site blocking interactions. In addition, the penetration analysis of the vdW surface electrostatic potential of the enantiomers involved (for all COAs and 2-APA) was provided in Fig. S18-S19. The vdW surface electrostatic potentials of enantiomers were significantly different, which indicated potential implications for the complexation behaviour of compounds induced by electrostatic interactions, especially for the complexation behaviour between these chiral compounds. There were significant differences in the weak interactions between enantiomeric combinations. The interaction of IBF-R vs. MA-L was significantly stronger than that of IBF-R vs. MA-D. It implies a stronger affinity for binding between homochiral compounds and a weaker interaction between heterochiral compounds. These phenomena were corroborated by IBF-S vs. MA-D and IBF-S vs. MA-L. Similarly, the enantiomeric pairs of KTF, NPX, and CRF (Fig. S20-22) with MA were also verified by DFT calculations. The promising results validate our initial hypothesis COAs affect the sorption behaviour of 2-APA enantiomers on the quartz surface via a series of interactions, thus facilitating the transport of 2-APA enantiomers and stimulating stereoselective transport of different enantiomers.

## 3.5. Limitations and future research

Our study analyzes in depth the mechanism responsible for the stereoselective transport behavior arising from the chiral differences between COAs and 2-APA enantiomeric pairs. However, remaining mysteries involve interactions between multiple COAs enantiomers triggered by the more central carbon atoms of COAs with man-made chiral pharmaceuticals. Currently, it is difficult to distinguish the interactions between COAs with more than 2 central carbon atoms and man-made chiral pharmaceuticals, which would require more space to describe this variation. Additionally, the concentrations regarding the introduced COAs and 2-APA enantiomer pairs still need to be further concentrated to match the existing concentrations of 2-APA in the environment (orders of magnitude typically μ g L GLYPH<0> $^{1}$). To better model the difference in interaction forces between the 2-APA enantiomers for COAs, we used 2-APA concentrations greater than ambient concentrations. The future direction of research regarding the transport differences of man-made chiral pharmaceuticals induced by chiral interactions should tend to the synergistic effect of different environmental ions. It is necessary to consider the co-transport of colloids or nanoparticles with man-made chiral pharmaceuticals, such as microplastic. As redefined by our study, the presence of more natural chiral products like COAs and the presence of more man-made chiral products resembling 2-APA derivatives in natural ecosystems, which need to be re-evaluated in subsequent studies for stereochemistry interactions between them. The differences triggered by chiral interactions cannot be ignored.

## 4. Conclusion

The effects of COAs on the transport behaviour of 2-APA chiral pharmaceuticals were verified in the study. Preliminary findings confirm the introduction of COAs promotes the mobility of 2-APA, regardless of the homochirality or heterochirality of COAs between 2APA as also for different types of COAs. The elevated pH promoted the transport of 2-APA via electrostatic repulsive effects and attenuated the stereoselective differences of COAs for different 2-APA enantiomers. The DFT calculations confirmed our initial hypothesis that a stronger interaction exists between the homochiral COAs and 2-APA enantiomer compared to the heterochiral COAs and 2-APA enantiomers. It is the

Journal of Hazardous Materials 468 (2024) 133824 Xu et al.

predominant cause of the difference in affinity of 2-APA enantiomeric pairs for sand, which leads to different transport behaviour of 2-APA enantiomers. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the transport behavior of chiral compounds distinguishing different enantiomers in future studies. A more in-depth study focusing on the transport behavior of enantiomeric pairs under different physicochemical conditions would contribute to reveal the important chiral role of enantiomeric transport under complex environmental conditions and provide a more efficient way for the removal of chiral compounds.

Release of PhACs into natural eco-environment creates significant hazards, leading to long-term exposure of non-target organisms. Assessing the transport and fate of PhACs in environment requires consideration of the stereoselective interactions effects. The transport of typical PhACs (2-APA) was investigated by sand-filled column experiments. The retention mechanism of enantiomeric pairs was revealed by batch sorption experiments and density-functional theory. This work is dedicated to unraveling the transport of 2-APA and the mechanisms influence the stereoselective transport of the enantiomers. It provides theoretical support for the removal of 2-APA and their enantiomers from the environment.
