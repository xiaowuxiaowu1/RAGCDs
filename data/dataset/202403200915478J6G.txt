## ABSTRACT

How to prepare clean energy has always been a problem to be solved by the modern green chemical industry. Compared with the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen, electrolysis of seawater for raw material requirements are lower and more widely used. However, the lacks of maturity of the technology, the high cost and the generation of harmful gases such as chlorine in the electrocatalytic process have hindered the development of this process. This study demonstrates a construction of heterogeneous structure based on Co ions as an efficient multifunctional catalyst for overall seawater splitting and urea oxidation. This hybrid structure can combine nanosheets and nanowires, thus exposing the catalyst to more active sites and shortening the ion diffusion path. Comparing the hybrid structure with the single structure, Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP exhibits excellent multifunctional catalytic activity in alkaline seawater and urea. In the oxygen evolution reaction, the working potential is only 1.60 V and 1.70 V at a current density of 50 mA/cm$^{2 }$and 100 mA/cm$^{2}$. And in the hydrogen evolution reaction, the working potential was only GLYPH<0> 0.16 V at a current density of GLYPH<0> 10 mA/cm$^{2}$, demonstrating excellent bifunctional activity. On this basis, the catalyst also demonstrated excellent activity for urea oxidation reaction in alkaline environment, with an operating potential of only 1.28 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm$^{2}$. And the durability of this catalyst is good, it can keep 5 mA/cm$^{2 }$for 12 h under the constant voltage of 1.45 V, but the initial potential falls off too fast, and there is a decline in performance, which is closely related to the corrosion of Cl$^{- }$present in seawater. It was shown by density functional theory (DFT) that hierarchical nanostructures can increase the transfer rate of reaction intermediates and the water adsorption energy. At the end of this study, by comparing single nanostructures with hybrid nanostructures, it can be reasonably conjectured that the accompanying increase in the number the heterostructure is resistant to Cl$^{- }$corrosion in seawater.

## 1. Introduction

Hydrogen has always been an excellent clean energy, and more and more in line with the requirements of the green chemical industry with the progress of the times, if the process is mature and stable, hydrogen can largely replace the traditional fossil fuels, and due to the characteristics of hydrogen, it can be done in the industry to achieve energy saving and efficiency [1 -6]. In industrial hydrogen production, water splitting for hydrogen production is considered to be a promising as well as clean and environmentally friendly way to comply with green chemistry, but it is still not implemented on a large scale [7 -12]. On this basis, the seawater splitting to produce hydrogen is more unlimited by raw materials than the fresh water splitting to produce hydrogen, of course, the difficulty of seawater splitting is also higher. In previous

studies, laboratory seawater splitting commonly uses precious metals as catalysts [13 -17]. Indeed, precious metals have excellent corrosion resistance to chlorine ions in seawater splitting and maintain a highly efficient single-electrode catalytic performance. But the inherent properties of precious metals, scarcity and cost, make them uncompetitive in industrial production. And there is no way to achieve bifunctional and efficient catalysis with precious metals as substrates, and each electrocatalyst is often incompatible with other reaction systems. Therefore, the development of catalysts capable of efficient bifunctional catalysis in seawater and resistant to seawater corrosion, as well as inexpensive and easily available, is imminent. Utilizing transition metals is much more cost-effective than precious metals. Transition metals are not only readily available but also inexpensive, and there have been many previous studies showing that transition metals and their derivate have

equally good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities in seawater splitting [18 -24]. However, conventional catalysts are very unstable for Direct Seawater Splitting (DSS) due to the presence of a large number of chloride ions in seawater splitting, which may corrode the oxidation catalysts due to the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) in the electrolysis cell, resulting in the loss of the catalyst active sites [25 -31]. Therefore, an important idea in this study is to enhance the electrocatalytic performance by adding more active sites and enhancing the conductivity [32 -34]. Cobalt-based oxides (Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$), for example, exhibit excellent OER catalytic activity by rapidly forming metal hydroxides in alkaline solutions. In contrast, cobalt-based phosphide (CoP) has good adsorption of H$_{2 }$and can exhibit excellent HER activity. It is worth noting that doping of Co and construction of heterogeneous interfaces is one of the effective ways to improve the catalyst activity, mainly by enhancing the interaction of the catalyst with intermediates during the reaction. Extensive progress has been made in utilizing these materials for water splitting, but performance improvements have been achieved primarily at the laboratory scale. Until now, the electrolysis of seawater is still an undeveloped field. In the early 1970s, scientists proposed the idea of producing hydrogen by direct splitting seawater. For nearly half a century, research teams at home and abroad have been conducting relevant research. However, the principle and technology of large-scale efficient and stable direct splitting seawater hydrogen production are still not smooth. It is hoped that this study can provide an effective idea for preparing effective direct splitting seawater to produce clean energy.

Based on the above analysis, a catalyst consisting of heterostructured nanoarrays of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP was designed and prepared for efficient seawater splitting for hydrogen production in alkaline seawater. The complexes with nanoarrays are generated by hydrothermal method to produce precursors, and then the final target catalysts are prepared by calcination and phosphatization. This target catalyst synergistically acts to enhance the catalytic performance of OER and HER by introducing oxides and phosphides as a way to establish strong electronic interactions. This hybrid structure can combine nanosheets and nanowires, one-dimensional nanostructures expose more catalytically active sites, and two-dimensional nanostructures allow for rapid electron transfer[44 -47]. Through experiments as well as electrochemical tests, the synthesized Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP target catalyst in alkaline seawater, was found to have an operating potential of only 1.60 V at a current density of 50 mA/cm$^{2 }$and 1.70 V at 100 mA/cm$^{2 }$for OER. The HER, on the other hand, has an operating potential of only GLYPH<0> 0.16 V at a current density of GLYPH<0> 10 mA/cm$^{2}$. Also in alkaline seawater, when overall water splitting was performed, the operating potential was only 1.60 V at a

Powdered catalysts need to be attached to the collector, such as nickel foam (NF), a foam metal. The direct growth of the active material on the nickel foam also enhances the catalyst-substrate contact for efficient electron transfer in the water splitting reaction. Porous NFs have advantages in enhancing the mass transport of electrolytes, making it as suitable candidates for collectors with high surface area characteristics in energy applications. Compared with pure powder catalysts, electrodes with self-supporting structures can work more than at high current densities of 100 mA/cm$^{2}$. Self-supporting materials can effectively prolong the working time while maintaining superior stability and performance, and shorten the process from the laboratory to industrial applications, so the development of electrodes with self-supporting roles is of great significance in practical applications [35 -38]. The uniform growth of the powder on the carrier will have a larger specific surface area and electron mobility, as well as better thermal conductivity and quantum hall effect. Meanwhile, the foam metal carrier has a large specific surface area, which promotes mass diffusion, exposes more catalytic active sites and improves the catalytic performance. Although much progress has been made in the study of the use of foam metals as self-supported catalyst materials, little progress has been made on heterojunction self-supported catalysts composed of transition metal oxides and phosphides[39 -43].

current density of 10 mA/cm$^{2}$. On this basis, the catalyst also demonstrated excellent activity for urea oxidation reaction in alkaline environment, with an operating potential of only 1.28 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm$^{2}$. And it can be stabilized for up to 12 h under the stability test of alkaline seawater, demonstrating considerable potential for practical application.

## 2. Experiments section

## 2.1. Chemicals and materials

Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O)), ammonium fluoride (NH$_{4}$F), urea (CO(NH$_{2}$)$_{2}$). All of them were purchased from Aladdin Company, and the vials were of analytical grade without further purification. The seawater was taken from Qingdao City, Shandong Province, and used after suction filtration.

## 2.2. Synthesis of materials

## 2.2.1. Synthesis of CoCOH@NF precursor

A one-step hydrothermal method was used to grow CoCOH@NF precursors on the NF surface. Nickel foam (3 cm*6 cm) was first cleaned by ultrasonication in ethanol and deionized water for 15 mins sequentially. 0.66 g Co(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O, 0.178 g NH$_{4}$F and 0.72 g Co(NH$_{2}$)$_{2 }$were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water. The cleaned NF and the mixture were added to a 100 mL Teflon high-pressure reactor and hydrothermalized at 120 · C for 10 h. After the heating was completed and waiting for cooling, the sample was removed, washed it with deionized water to flush the surface of uneven precipitation, and finally placed in a drying oven to dry the CoCOH@NF precursor.

## 2.2.2. Synthesis of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP

Subsequently, the prepared Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF was placed in a tube furnace, and NaH$_{2}$PO$_{2}$ · H$_{2}$O (0.5 g) was upstream of the tube furnace, and phosphatized in an atmosphere of N$_{2 }$at an elevated temperature rate of 2 · C/min to 300 · C for two hours, and the prepared catalyst was labeled as Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP. The loading mass on the NF was approximately 3.0 mg/ cm$^{2}$. With the different processes producing the catalysts as experimental groups, longitudinal comparison experiments were performed.

The precursor after the first hydrothermal step was washed and dried, and labeled as CoCOH@NF. The dried precursor was taken out, placed on top of a ceramic boat, and then placed into a dry muffle furnace at an elevated temperature of 2 · C/min to 400 · C, calcined and oxidized for four hours, and the prepared catalyst was labeled as Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF.

## 2.2.3. Computational details

DFT calculations are performed using the Cambridge Sequence Total Energy Packet (CASTEP) and plane-wave pseudopotential methods. The geometries of the Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$ and CoP planes are optimized using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method. Modified PerdewBurke-Ernzerh of (RPBE) functions is used to handle electron exchange-related interactions. 7*7*1 and 5*5*1 of Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$ and CoP Monkhorst Pack lattice for k points and a plane-wave basis set cutoff energy of 500 eV are used for the integration of the Brillouin zone. The energy and force convergence of the optimized structure are set to 1.0 × 10$^{-5 }$eV and 0.05 eV/A, respectively.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Synthesis and characterization of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP with heterostructure

Fig. 1a shows the synthesis of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP with heterogeneous structure, in which nickel foam with large specific surface area as well as excellent electrical conductivity is used as support material. First, CoCOH@NF precursor was grown on the NF surface by a hydrothermal

method, and then the synthesized catalyst was calcined and oxidized to obtain Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF. Finally, the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP target catalyst was prepared by thermal phosphorylation reaction. Fig. 1b-d shows the typical morphology and structure of the catalyst at different stages. Firstly, precursors with nanoneedle structures were successfully grown on nickel foam carriers by Co(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O, NH$_{4}$F and Co(NH$_{2}$)$_{2 }$following a one-step hydrothermal method, as shown in Fig. S1a-1b. After the precursor is calcined and oxidized, it can be seen that the surface of the precursor nanoneedles becomes rough and uneven, and nanorods are gradually formed, and it is not difficult to see that the nanorods also have a porous structure under the precision of 100 nm test. Moreover, in Fig. S2a-2b, it can be seen that there still exists a part of the nanoneedle structure that has not been completely oxidized into nanorods. This also paves the way for the phosphatization in the next step, which is enough to support the formation of the complex after thermal phosphatization

treatment. Finally, the phosphating treatment was carried out and uniform nanowires as well as

nanosheets can be seen to be formed and the diameter of the nanowires can be seen to be roughly 50 nm (Fig. 1b, S4). It is not difficult to see from the SEM characterization that Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP complexes with a heterogeneous structure were initially synthesized. As shown in Fig. 1cf, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1c and S5), highresolution TEM (Fig. 1d) and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP showed lattice fringes with different orientations throughout the visualization, with lattice fringes spaced at 0.202 nm and 0.200 nm, which were assigned to the (400) facet of Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$and (210) facet of CoP, respectively. The existence of two crystal face structure compositions makes it more possible to determine that the complex Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP has indeed grown on the nickel foam surface. The mapping (Fig. 1g) and energy dispersive X-ray spectra (Fig. S6) can

further prove that Co and Ni are uniformly distributed throughout the nanostructure, and the P and O elements are distributed in a nonhomogeneous phase, which can prove that Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$ is partially phosphorylated successfully to form a Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP catalyst. In addition, as can be seen in Fig. S6, the surface atomic percentages of Co, O, and P are 34.97 %, 43.93 %, and 6.09 %, respectively.

Elemental valence states of compound can be analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF and Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP showed the presence of C, O, and Co (Fig.S7). In the Co 2p spectra of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP (Fig. 2b), the peaks at 797.97/795.62 eV and 781.84/775.12 eV correspond to Co 2p$_{1/2 }$ and Co 2p$_{3/2 }$ [50,51], respectively, where the peaks at 797.97 and 781.84 eV correspond to the Co-O bonds in Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$and the 795.62 and 775.12 eV peaks correspond to Co-P bonds in CoP [52 -54]. Compared with the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP sample, the binding energy of Co 2p in the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF sample is significantly shifted,

The composition and structure of the crystals were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the catalyst after hydrothermal reaction showed typical peaks of Co(OH)CO$_{3 }$ (PDF# 48 ---0083)[48], and the catalyst after undergoing calcination oxidation also showed typical peaks of Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$(PDF# 43 -1003)[49] and no excess heterogeneous peaks, which can be seen that the smooth synthesis of CoCOH@NF and Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF on the support material was successful. In the CoP@NF sample, we can see the typical peaks of CoP (PDF# 29 -0497) and the typical peaks of CoP (PDF# 29 -0497) are consistent with the presence of the peaks of the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP sample, and the surface samples were successfully phosphorized. There is also a small amount of Co$_{2}$P (PDF# 32 -0306) present in the mixture, which may be due to the problem of not being able to tightly control the degree of phosphatization. The increase in P content tends to increase the degree of charge distribution inhomogeneity, but it does not have much effect on the performance results of the final target catalysts. The peaks of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP sample, on the other hand, are in good agreement with the (511), (440), and (311) of Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$(PDF# 43 -1003), so the above results can prove that the hybridized phase of Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$and CoP was successfully constructed in the target catalyst.

which can also prove the successful construction of the hybridized phase of Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$and CoP by phosphorylation on the basis of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF. It was also demonstrated that the d-band center of Co was also shifted downward and that electronic interactions were generated between Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$ and CoP. This electronic interaction leads to a redistribution of electrons between the Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$and CoP active components, favoring an increase in electrochemical activity. The O 1 s energy spectrum further confirms the existence of electronic interactions between Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$ and CoP, and the presence of positive shifts can be observed in the comparison of the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP sample with the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF energy spectrum, in agreement with the results shown by the spectra of Co [55 -57]. It is worth noting the presence of metal hydroxyl groups and peaks of absorbing water for Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF and Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP (Fig. 2c).

## 3.2. Oxygen and hydrogen evolution catalysis

In this study, a Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP catalyst with synergistically tuned heterostructured nano-arrays was prepared and electrochemically test was done under alkaline seawater solution. As shown in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve results of Fig. 3a, the as-prepared Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP catalyst exhibits excellent electrochemical activity at OER compared to the rest of the catalysts. The front-end performance slightly overlaps with the rest of the catalysts, which may be due to the excellent water adsorption ability of Co ions, but in the back-end, it can be clearly seen that the target catalysts have better OER performance than the rest of the catalysts, with an operating potential of only 1.60 V at a current density of 50 mA/cm$^{2}$, and 1.70 V at 100 mA/cm$^{2}$, which is significantly better than that of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF and CoP@NF. Notably, the overall better performance of the CoCOH@NF precursor than Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF can be observed in Fig. 3a. It is reasonable to assume that this difference is assigned to the presence of too many Co-O bonds in the calcined and oxidized material, thus weakening the Co adsorption energy for water. This can also be observed in subsequent tests. In addition, the overall performance of CoP@NF is also significantly better than that of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF, and the reason for this can be found in the previous XDR characterization results,

Wang et al.

where the complex Co$_{2}$P appeared in the CoP@NF experimental group because of the different content of P. Density-functional theory calculations show that the density of states at the Fermi energy level of Co$_{2}$P is higher than that of Co$_{n}$P (0 < n < 2), which promotes the catalytic process of electron transfer and intermediate adsorption, so that the experimental group of phosphorylated alone will have better results than the oxides in electrochemical tests in alkaline seawater [58]. Continuing to observe the slope of the C$_{dl }$curve (Fig. 3b, S8), it can be clearly seen that the slope of the target catalyst is 154.76 mF/cm$^{2}$, which is superior to the rest of the experimental group, and has more excellent electrochemical activity. However, it is rather flawed that in the electrochemical EIS test (Fig. 3c), the target catalyst did not demonstrate a significantly smaller radius, which, combined with the direct electrochemical test in alkaline seawater, can be reasonably inferred to be the corrosion of the anode by seawater. In the Tafel slope (Fig. 3d), it can be observed that the slope of the target catalyst is 45.21 mV/dec, which is significantly better than the rest of the experimental groups. The above result indicates that the target catalyst has faster reaction kinetics in alkaline seawater. Limiting to the electrochemical EIS test results, it can only be inferred that the target catalyst still needs to further refine the process in the OER test.

The catalyst was tested to have equally good HER performance in alkaline seawater. As shown in the LSV curve results of Fig. 4a, the target catalyst exhibits significantly more excellent electrochemical performance on HER than the rest of the catalysts, with an operating potential of only GLYPH<0> 0.16 V at a current density of GLYPH<0> 10 mA/cm$^{2}$. It can be seen that the whole target catalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional activity in alkaline seawater. As in the OER test, it was possible to observe an overall better performance of CoCOH@NF than Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF in the HER test, which is also the same as in the previous test, and again it can be assumed that the water adsorption of the catalyst was affected to some extent after the calcination oxidation. In the C$_{dl }$plot (Fig. 4b, S9), it can be seen that the C$_{dl }$slope of the target catalyst is 3.94 mF/cm$^{2}$, which is also significantly larger than the rest of the catalysts. In the EIS plot

(Fig. 4c), it can be seen that HER and OER are clearly different and it can be seen that the target catalyst is clearly superior to the rest of the catalysts in the EIS plot of HER. It can be reasonably inferred that the OER reaction that occurs at the anode has an oxidative corrosion effect in alkaline seawater, and the corrosion of the anode electrodes is more severe compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, so it leads to the EIS test results of the OER experimental group to be significantly inferior to that of the HER. It can be observed in the Tafel slope (Fig. 4d) that the slope of the target catalyst is 171.13 mV/dec, which is better than the rest of the experimental group, further suggesting that the catalyst has better reaction kinetics.

## 3.3. Urea oxidation catalysis

At the end of the OER and HER tests, an additional urea oxidation test (UOR) was performed with a complete electrochemical test in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M urea solution. As can be seen in the LSV plot (Fig. 5a), the target catalyst clearly outperforms the remaining catalysts throughout the operating voltage. At a current density of 10 mA/cm$^{2}$, the working potential is only 1.28 V, in which it can be observed that the performance of the CoCOH@NF precursor is not much different from the trend of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF. Combining the test results in alkaline seawater, it can be reasonably inferred that there is no obvious advantage or disadvantage in the electrocatalytic performance of hydroxides and oxides in Co-based catalysts. The C$_{dl }$slope (Fig. 5b, S10) of the target catalyst can be seen as 155.8 mF/cm$^{2 }$in the C$_{dl }$plot, which is significantly superior to the rest of the catalysts. In addition, it can be seen in the EIS plot (Fig. 5c) that the target catalyst does not have a clear advantage over the rest of the catalysts, which is the same as the previous results of testing OER in alkaline seawater. It is still possible to maintain the previous conjecture that in the process of electrocatalytic oxygen production from alkaline solution, the anode electrode undergoes intense oxidative corrosion reaction, which can be seen in the stability test and the overall water splitting test afterwards. In the Tafel slope plot (Fig. 5d), it can be seen

that the slope of the target catalyst is 18.87 mV/dec, which is obviously superior to the rest of the catalysts. The experiment was not performed to test electrocatalysis in alkaline seawater splitting with urea because it does change the kinetics of the reaction and bring the electrochemically active potential more forward due to the addition of urea to alkaline seawater. However, it is still essentially an experiment of direct urea splitting, and the addition of urea followed by electrolysis is not so important compared to direct seawater splitting.

## 3.4. Overall seawater splitting

Because of the excellent electrocatalytic activity of OER and HER, electrochemical tests for overall seawater splitting were performed on the basis of half-reaction experiments. The Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP catalyst was used as a cathode and anode to study the overall water splitting performance in an alkaline seawater environment. A large number of gas bubbles were clearly observed on the catalyst surface as shown in Fig. S11. However, due to the limitation of laboratory conditions, there was no way to carry out further gas collection work. As shown in Fig. 6a, during the 12 h stability test, Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP double electrodes operated continuously and stably under the condition of 5 mA/cm$^{2}$, and the

After the stability test, the physicochemical characterization before and after the IT test was further compared. As can be seen in Fig. 7a-d, no matter Co 2p, O 1 s or P 2p, the composition and valence states of all elements have been changed, and it can be significantly observed that certain electron offset also occurs after OER stability test. During the stability test, a lot of dust fell off the anode electrode, which can be observed in Fig. S11. When the foam load is changed, other impurities such as Ca(OH)$_{2 }$and Mg(OH)$_{2 }$and other hydroxides may be attached in alkaline seawater, resulting in electron migration of the element. The XPS survey (Fig. 7a) showed more clearly that after OER stability test, the peaks of both Co 2p and P 2p decreased, which also confirmed that

Fig. 6. (a) Stability test of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP for 12 h. (b) LSV curves before and after 12 h test.

results showed that the target catalyst had excellent stability within 12 h. As can be observed in Fig. 6b, the dual-electrode system composed of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP only needs 1.6 V to reach 10 mA/cm$^{2 }$before stability test. IT can also be seen from the LSV curve, although the overall electrochemical activity after the I-T test has decreased compared with that before the I-T test, the working current at 10 mA/cm$^{2 }$has not decreased significantly, so it can be confirmed that the catalyst has excellent stability and the activity remains stable overall. However, the disadvantage is that the overall working current density is not high, and industrial applications cannot be achieved for the time being.

the catalyst did fall off NF during the stability test. XRD peaks also become less pronounced, demonstrating generation of amorphous species (Fig.S12). It can be seen from the SEM image that the morphology of the material is completely maintained, but the surface corrosion occurs (Fig.S13). It is worth noting that the in situ produced oxyhydroxide are the true active species.

## 3.5. Theoretical investigation of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP catalyst

After density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the atomic structure of the target catalyst can be clearly observed. By observing the atomic structure of the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP target catalyst, as shown in Fig. 8ab, it can be clearly seen that water adsorption model on oxides and phosphide was successfully constructed. In addition, the calculated density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level of CoP is more significantly than Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$, which proves that CoP has excellent electronic conductivity

and intrinsic metallic properties, and its catalytic performance will be significantly improved (Fig. 8c). It is worth noting that the total density distribution of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP comes mainly from the d orbitals of Co and the p orbitals of P (Fig. S14-15). As can be seen from Fig. 8d, oxides have better adsorption energy for water ( GLYPH<0> 0.94 eV) than phosphide ( GLYPH<0> 0.78 eV). This seems to be slightly different from the results of previous LSV tests, where it was found that the electrochemical activity of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@NF is lower than that of CoP@NF. However, these two results do not conflict because the adsorption energy for water calculated here is for the whole target catalyst Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP. It can be guessed that in the actual experiment, the synergistic catalysis of the Co$_{3}$O$_{4 }$ and CoP catalysts and the constructions of heterogeneous interfaces promote the catalytic activity of the materials. Secondly, as mentioned above, the complex Co$_{2}$P appears in the CoP@NF experimental group due to the different content of P. Density functional theory calculation shows that the density of states of Co$_{2}$P at Fermi level is higher than that of Co$_{n}$P (0 < n < 2), which promotes electron transfer and intermediate adsorption in the catalytic process, so the experimental group of phosphating will have better electrochemical test results in alkaline seawater than the oxide[58]. However, some conclusions can be drawn from the adsorption energy results, that is, the adsorption energy of oxides for water is greater than phosphide. In summary, this nanostructure not only increases the base area of the catalyst from two and three dimensions,

## 4. Conclusions

In this experiment, the Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP with heterostructure composite electrode was prepared by hydrothermal calcination phosphating. The single and two-dimensional hybrid structures and the synergistic action between oxides and phosphates give Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP catalyst excellent electrochemical activity and better reaction kinetics. The nanoheterostructure can make full use of all active sites, significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of the catalyst, especially in alkaline seawater, and still maintain excellent working potential. In the oxygen evolution reaction, the working potential is only 1.60 V when the current density is 50 mA/cm$^{2}$. Under the condition of 100 mA/cm$^{2}$, the working potential is only 1.70 V. In the hydrogen evolution reaction, the working potential is only 0.16 V under the condition of current density of 10 mA/cm$^{2}$, showing excellent bifunctional activity. In addition, the catalyst also showed excellent activity for urea oxidation reaction in alkaline environment, and the working potential was only 1.28 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm$^{2}$. At the same time, in the overall water splitting process, the two-electrode system composed of Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP only needs 1.60 V to reach 10 mA/cm$^{2}$. It also shows excellent stability in alkaline seawater, and it can be reasonably inferred that the catalyst has a certain ability to resist corrosion oxidation due to phosphating. Based on the above results, it can be concluded that Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$@CoP has excellent performance in overall seawater splitting, and can be used as a promising candidate for future industrial seawater electrolysis after further optimization of the process. The drawback is that in the long-term electrocatalytic process, the overall working current density is not high, and industrial applications cannot be achieved for the time being, and further optimization of the process is required.
