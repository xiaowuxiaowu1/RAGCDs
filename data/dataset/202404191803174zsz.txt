## ABSTRACT

The research on the adsorption and conversion of non-polar gases (carbon dioxide, hydrogen, iodine, etc.) has attracted global attention. Extensive work has revealed the intuitive impact of the heteroatom effect on the adsorption performance of covalent organic framework (COF) adsorbents for non-polar gases. However, more influencing factors must be studied to more precisely design and construct target-specific COF adsorbents. In this work, an underlying influencing factor, local polarity, is discovered, which is defined as the polarity of the functional moiety. Due to the substitution of strong electrophile, the electron cloud distribution of the COF framework is regulated, and the local polarity that better matches the adsorption of target electrophilic gas (iodine) has been observed. The local polarity of COF has been controlled through several strong electrophilic ionic liquids, dramatically improving adsorption performance. The saturated adsorption capacity increases from 1.5 to 5.2 g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, and the adsorption kinetics index k$_{80% }$value increases from 0.51 to 2.69 g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1$_{·}$}$h GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. The insight would support precise chemical regulation of target-specific COF in energy and environment science.

## 1. Introduction

Concern about the increase in global energy demand is balanced with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which has promoted research on clean, safe, and responsible nuclear energy [1 -3]. A primary safety issue related to nuclear energy is the appropriate management of nuclear waste streams, including $^{137}$Cs, $^{90}$Sr, $^{99}$Tc, etc. fission products, minor actinides, lanthanides, and volatile radionuclides [4 -6]. It is particularly challenging to capture volatile gaseous fission products, including $^{129}$I and $^{131}$I, $^{85}$Kr, $^{3}$H$_{2, }$and $^{14}$CO$_{2}$, from nuclear fuel reprocessing or unintentional environmental releases [7,8]. Among them, radioactive iodine (I$_{2}$) has high mobility in most geological environments, and its isotopes have a unique exposure problem [9,10].  $^{129}$I isotope is long-lived with a half-life of 1.6 x10$^{7 }$years, which must be reliably captured and stored during the decay process [11,12]; while $^{131}$I is a very short-lived isotope with a half-life of 8.02 days, but it needs to be captured immediately, because it directly affects the metabolic process of the human body, especially, thyroid gland [13,14]. Therefore, the development of functional materials for effective control of radioactive iodine vapor emissions is of great significance. However, there are

still many unclear factors regarding the precise construction of highperformance task-specific adsorbents.

Currently, diverse porous materials have been developed and investigated to capture I$_{2 }$ by porous adsorbents, including activated carbon [15], zeolites [16,17], porous organic polymers [18,19], metal organic frameworks [20,21], covalent organic frameworks [22 -24]. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of highly ordered crystalline organic polymers composed of light elements, first synthesized and reported by Omar Yaghi and co-workers [25,26]. COFs have been extensively studied in the fields of chemistry and material engineering. For gas adsorption and separation applications, introducing heteroatoms into the COF structure is an effective approach to improve their performance [27]. The heteroatoms in COFs, such as N and S can provide active sites and change the electron distribution of the system [28]. It is becoming a widespread strategy to introduce heteroatoms such as nitrogen, fluorine, sulfur, and oxygen into the structure of COFs for various applications [29,30]. Wang and Han et al. obtained nitrogenrich covalent organic framework materials by introducing bipyridine groups into the building blocks for the capture of iodine gas through enhanced electron-pair effect [31]. Nitrogen-rich 1,2,4,5-

tetracarbonitrile benzene (TCNB) was selected as the solely organic building block to construct 2D conjugated COFs, which exhibited excellent iodine enrichment with 2.99 g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$for volatile iodine, reported by Wang group [32]. Li et al. constructed two nitrogen-rich COFs, TFBT1 and TFBT-2, by condensation of an acylamide-containing building block with tris(4-formylphenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5-tris(p-formylphenyl)benzene (TAPB), and achieved iodine uptake capacity of 3.15 g · g GLYPH<0> 1 for TFBT-1 and 2.60 g · g GLYPH<0> 1 for TFBT-2 [33]. Ma and Li et al. designed and constructed several 2D hexagonal COFs using a spatially twisted four-link multi-nitrogen nodes building block (tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)-1,4benzenediamine (TAPD)), and obtained improved iodine capture capabilities [34]. The rich nitrogen content leads to an exciting heteroatom effect, which is believed to be a strong interaction between nitrogen atoms and iodine molecules that significantly facilitates adsorption [35]. Previous works have focused on nitrogen-rich COFs by designing and changing building blocks, which may have limitations. The introduction of heteroatoms is aimed at changing the local electron distribution, thereby affecting the overall performance of the COF materials. The classic COFs with benzene ring as the main building block has strong aromaticity and conjugation, resulting in uniform electron cloud distribution and no electron-rich moiety. Therefore, its affinity for electrophilic targets (such as iodine molecules) is very weak, indicating poor adsorption performance. Modifying the aromatic frameworks by strong electrophiles and changing its electron cloud distribution to enhance its local electron-rich properties should significantly improve the performance. However, for the precise construction of target-specific COFs, more influencing factors need to be identified.

In this work, we proposed an ionic liquid solution process (ILSP) strategy to post-modify the neutral covalent organic framework TpPaSO$_{3}$H (COF-H) to improve its iodine capture performance (Fig. 1). Three ionic liquids with similar structures and degressive electrophilic properties were selected for ILSP post-modification of TpPaSO$_{3}$H, namely, 1butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmimBr), 4-methyl-1-butyl-1,2,4triazolium bromide (MC$_{4}$trimBr) and 4-amino-1-butyl-1,2,4-triazolium bromide (AC$_{4}$trimBr). The modified products were named COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim, respectively. The results show that with the introduction of strong electrophiles, significant changes in local polarity were observed, which is positively correlated with adsorption performance and plays a crucial role in improving performance. Imidazolium or triazolium cations replaced the protons of the sulfonic groups on the COF, resulting in electron cloud separation and increased local polarity, leading to a transition of the entire framework from neutral to ionic type. The ionic framework structure effectively enhances the electrostatic interaction between the framework and target molecules. It promotes the weak interaction between electron-rich region and electrophilic target molecules, where the weak interaction depends on introducing strong electrophiles and local polarity.

## 2. Material and methods

## 2.1. Synthesis of ionic liquids

4-Amino-1-butyl-1,2,4-triazolium bromide (AC$_{4}$trimBr) was obtained by using a slightly modified the literature procedure [36]. A mixture of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole (10 mmol, 840.4 mg) and 1-bromobutane (10 mmol, 1370.2 mg) was refluxed in acetonitrile (20 mL) for 3 days. The solution was concentrated and added to excess cold ethyl acetate (3 -5 times the volume of solution) for recrystallization. After filtering the solvent, remove any residual solvent under vacuum to obtain pale-yellow powders (2123 mg, 96 % of yield).

1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmimBr) was synthesized according to the literature procedure with modifications. To a solution of 1-methylimidazole (10 mmol, 821.1 mg) in acetonitrile (20 mL), 1bromobutane (10 mmol, 1370.1 mg) was added. The solution was stirred and refluxed for 3 days. The solution was concentrated and added to excess cold ethyl acetate (3 -5 times the volume of solution) for recrystallization. After filtering the solvent, remove any residual solvent under vacuum to obtain colorless powders (2126 mg, 97 % of yield).

1-Butyl-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazolium bromide (MC$_{4}$trimBr) was synthesized according to the literature procedure with a slight modification [36]. 4-Methyl-1,2,4-triazole (10 mmol, 830.9 mg) and 1-bromobutane (10 mmol, 1370.1 mg) were dissolved and refluxed in acetonitrile (20 mL) for 3 days. The solution was concentrated and added to excess cold ethyl acetate (3 -5 times the volume of solution) for recrystallization. After filtering the solvent, remove any residual solvent under vacuum to obtain colorless powders (2091 mg, 95 % of yield).

## 2.2. Preparation of COF-H

Synthesis of 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol. 2,4,6-Triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) was synthesized according to the literature procedure [37]. To 108 mmol (15.09 g) of hexamethylenetetraamine and 49 mmol (6.01 g) of dried phloroglucinol under nitrogen gas were added 90 mL trifluoroacetic acid. The solution was heated at 100 · C for 2.5 h. Approximately 150 mL of 3 M HCl was added and the solution was heated at 100 · C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was filtered through celite, extracted with 350 mL dichloromethane, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Rotary evaporation of the solution afforded 1.05 g (13 % of yield) of off-white powder.

COF-H (TpPaSO$_{3}$H) was synthesized referring to the literature procedure with a slight modification [38]. 0.4 mmol (84.1 mg) of 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) and 0.6 mmol (112.9 mg) 2,5diaminobenzenesulfonic acid (TpSO$_{3}$H) were charged into a Pyrex tube and mixed with 2 mL butyl alcohol and 2 mL 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL of 6 M aqueous acetic acid. After that, the tube was degassed by freeze -pump -thaw cycles three times, sealed under vacuum, and heated at 120 · C for 3 days. Afterward, the product was filtered and washed with H2O, THF, and acetone (10 mL × 3 for each), respectively, followed by the Soxhlet extraction with THF for 3 days. The obtained solids were dried at 80 · C in a vacuum for 48 h.

## 2.3. Preparation of COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim by ILSP

To a solution of 65.7 mg of BmimBr dissolved in 10 mL of isopropyl alcohol was added a solution of 16.8 mg of KOH dissolved in 10 mL of isopropyl alcohol. The mixture was sonicated for 30 s, and the white solid was filtered off to obtain a precursor ionic liquid solution. 87.8 mg of COF-H were mixed with 20 mL of the precursor ionic liquid solution and stirred for 12 h at room temperature until the solution was neutral. Afterward, the product was filtered and washed with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water (10 mL × 3 for each). The obtained solids (COFBmim) were dried at 80 · C in a vacuum for 48 h. COF-MC$_{4}$trim and COFAC$_{4}$trim were prepared according to a similar method as for COF-Bmim.

The actual loading of ionic liquid was determined using elemental analysis, see Table S5.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Preparation and characterization of COFs

Three types of ionic liquids were chosen, BmimBr, MC$_{4}$trimBr, and AC$_{4}$trimBr (the chemical structure shown in Figure S1), with electrophilicity decreasing sequentially. In the ILSP strategy, the protons on COF-H will be replaced with corresponding large-volume electrophilic cations. As shown in Fig. 2a, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of COF-H revealed strip-like morphology and well-ordered stacking. The clear lattice fringes TEM image (Figure S2) showed the high crystallinity of COF-H. The distance of about 1.9 nm corresponds to the diameter of the ordered pore size of COF-H, which is also in accordance with the pore size of COF-H in the literature [38]. The TEM images of the COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim and COF-AC$_{4}$trim shown in Fig. 2c and d were observed, respectively, random stacked COF nanosheets. The original stacking state had changed due to the increase in interlayer spacing of the COF layer after IL cations replace the acidic protons of the COF. The morphology of COF nanosheets was observed through atomic force microscope (AFM) images, and high analysis showed that the thickness of COF nanosheets ranged from 1.6 to 1.8 nm, see Figure S3. Because the IL cations are much larger than the original proton, the COFs will be stripped into COF nanosheets [39]. In the PXRD patterns (Figure S4), the diffraction peak located at 4.8 degrees belongs to the (100) crystal plane, and a decrease in its intensity was clearly observed.

This phenomenon also confirmed the formation of COF nanosheets, consistent with literature reports [40]. The formation of COF nanosheets means that the narrow and long pore structure of COFs is, to some extent, destroyed, and the active adsorption sites originally located on the inner surface of the pores will be directly exposed on the outer surface of the nanosheets. During the adsorption process, the pore effect will be weakened, and the adsorptive can directly contact the adsorption site to avoid passing through the narrow pore time, which may be beneficial for improving the adsorbent kinetics.

The porosity and surface area of COFs were measured by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Fig. 2e)[41]. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of COF-H, COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim and COF-AC$_{4}$trim calculated over the P/P$_{0 }$range of 0.05 ~ 0.30 were 100.0, 41.6, 34.7 and 46.6 m$^{2}$/g, respectively. The BET surface area of the obtained COFBmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim by ILSP decreased, which could be ascribed to the loss of original regular channels due to the random stacking of the COF sheets following exfoliation. The pore channel of COF obtained by ILSP also decreased from 1.9 nm to 1.5 nm, similar to the chemical exfoliation of COF materials reported by Khayum et al.[40] The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra (Fig. 2f) confirmed that COF-H, COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim and COFAC$_{4}$trim were successfully synthesized and ILSP did not cause damage to the COF-H framework structure, because the characteristic C -C double bond vibration band at 1573 ~ 1577 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and C-N bond vibration band at 1222 ~ 1230 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$were observed in FI-IR spectra of COF-H, COFBmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim and COF-AC$_{4}$trim in Fig. 2f. The vibration band of the C -N bond is not displayed, indicating the formation of the β -ketoenamine bond, which is conducive to the enhanced chemical

stability of COFs [42]. Several new bands (2860 ~ 2870 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, 2910 ~ 2970 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, and ~ 3120 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$) were found in the infrared spectra of COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim that were not present in COF-H, and they should belong to the stretching vibrations of methyl, methylene and/or amino groups on IL cations [43]. COF-H belongs to a neutral framework, and when acidic protons are replaced by many cations, the ionic properties near the sulfonic acid group are enhanced. A band splitting of the S -O stretching vibration was observed in Fig. 2f. The band at 1086 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$initially belonged to the S -O stretching vibration in COF-H, and was divided into two bands in COF-Bmim, COFMC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim: ~1096 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and ~ 1082 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$[44]. The FTIR results indicated that ILSP can effectively replace protons with large volume cations without affecting the chemical structure and linkage of the COF itself during this process. In addition, after replacing protons with bulk cations, the local charge separation of the framework can also cause changes in the polarity of the COF material. The relative polarity of COF-H, COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim was measured using FTIR spectroscopic probes [45]. N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) was chosen to be a probe IR molecular, and vibration of C -O for pure DMF occurs at 1675 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1, }$which does not conflict with any band of COF. When DMF is mixed with a substance with stronger polarity than DMF, the ν (C -O) value will cause a red shift. The larger the redshift range, the stronger the polarity. As displayed in Fig. 2g, the ν (C -O) value was 1655 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in the DMF/COF-H sample, while that of DMF/COF-Bmim was 1647 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. the ν (C -O) value of DMF/COF-MC$_{4}$trim and DMF/COF-AC$_{4}$trim also were 1647 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. The result indicated that those COF obtained by ILSP showed higher polarity than initial COF-H, also suggesting that ILSP can enhance the polarity of COF by replacing acidic protons with large volume electrophilic cations.

## 3.2. Adsorption capacity

The adsorption performance of COFs on iodine vapor were investigated by exposing them to iodine vapor at a temperature of 348 K under ambient pressure. As shown in Fig. 3a, COF-H, COF-Bmim, COFMC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim all exhibited rapid adsorption ability, reaching approximately 90 % of the saturated adsorption capacity within two hours (Fig. 3a). They reached adsorption saturation at 8 h, with saturation adsorption capacities of 1.5, 5.3, 2.7, and 4.5 g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. This result indicated that increasing IL cations ' electrophilicity can significantly improve the saturated adsorption capacity. However, as the electrophilicity gradually increased, the experimental

results showed an unexpected phenomenon. Taking the electron-rich property of amino groups into account, the result is also reasonable. It also prompts us to explore the deepest reasons. To gain insight into the adsorption behaviors of COFs, Lagergren pseudo-first-order, and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were employed [46], and fitting results were shown in Fig. 3c, 3d and Table S1, S2. The pseudo-secondorder kinetic model was found to better describe the adsorption process of iodine vapor on COFs over time, indicating that chemical sorption dominated the adsorption process. According to the literature, chemical sorption usually comes from active adsorption sites, which can significantly improve the material ' s adsorption capacity for iodine molecules [21]. Compared with COF-H, the saturated adsorption capacity of COFBmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim was significantly increased. It is speculated that the sulfonic acid group should be the adsorption site of COF-H. ILSP replaces the proton of the sulfonic acid group on the COFs with a large volume of imidazolium/triazolium cations, which cannot bind tightly to the sulfonic acid group, resulting in charge separation near the sulfonic acid group. The stronger electrostatic interaction caused by charge separation further activates this adsorption site, which may be the possible reason for the significant increase in saturated adsorption capacity.

## 3.3. Adsorption kinetics

The k$_{80% }$ value, defined as 80 % of saturated adsorption capacity/ adsorption time in g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1$_{·}$}$h GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, was proposed by Ma group [47] in 2020 to describe the adsorption kinetics of COF materials in iodine adsorption. In recent years, researchers in this field have recognized it as an adsorption kinetics descriptor. The k$_{80% }$ value of COF-H, COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim were 0.51, 2.69, 1.17, and 2.07 g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1$_{·}$}$h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in order (Fig. 3b). The dramatic improvement in adsorption kinetics may be attributed to the formation of COF nanosheets. The active adsorption sites of COF materials are located on the inner surface of regular pore channels, and the diffusion of iodine vapor to the adsorption sites requires passing through narrow pore channels, which takes more time. Transforming from a COF crystal to a COF nanosheet, the pore channels are truncated. The activated sulfonic acid group adsorption sites are directly exposed on the outer surface of the nanosheets, which can directly contact iodine molecules and complete adsorption, saving time for diffusion in the pores. Therefore, they exhibited better adsorption kinetics index. The saturated adsorption capacity and the k$_{80% }$ value of various porous adsorbents for iodine adsorption are listed in Table S3. It is worth noting that compared to the

First-order pseudo kinetic fitting (c) and second-order pseudo kinetic fitting (d) of COFs in the iodine adsorption process. (e) Comparison between the k$_{80% }$value of COFs in this work and the reported value in the literature.

reported COFs materials used for iodine adsorption, to our knowledge, the COF-Bmim in this work possesses the best adsorption kinetics k$_{80% }$ value (Fig. 3e). It also indicates that the proposed ILSP strategy to introduce strong electrophiles significantly improves the adsorption performance of COF adsorbents.

## 3.4. Adsorption mechanism analysis

To gain a deeper understanding of the enhanced capture mechanism of iodine on COFs, time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (TR-FTIR), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed. In Fig. 4a -c, TR-FTIR of COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim were collected for 0 ~ 120 min during the iodine adsorption process. These bands associated with the ν (C -C) at 1573 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, ν (C-N) at 1227 cm GLYPH<0> 1 and ν (C-H) at 815 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in COF-Bmim, the ν (C -C) at 1573 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, ν (C-N) at 1222 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and ν (C-H) at 812 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and the ν (C -C) at 1577 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, ν (C-N) at 1230 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and ν (C-H) at 819 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in COFAC$_{4}$trim underwent a gradual blue shift. The bands belonging to cations also exhibited a blue shift, from 1434 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$to 1428 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in COF-Bmim, from 1430 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$to 1426 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and from 1437 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$to 1432 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$in COF-AC$_{4}$trim. It was also observed that the band strength

of S -O at 1905 ~ 1908 cm GLYPH<0> 1 gradually weakened over time in Fig. 4a -c. However, shown as Figure S5, no blue shift was observed in the band of COF-H except for ν (C -C). The TR-FTIR results indicate that in the process of iodine adsorption and charge-transfer complex formation, strong electrophiles modified moieties in COFs, including sulfonic groups, imidazolium/triazolium cations, and heteroatoms enhanced interaction with target iodine [48]. It also reflects the inhibitory effect of tightly bound protons on the adsorption of sulfonic groups; electrophile can activate sulfonic groups or even the entire framework by replacing protons. Raman spectra were employed to analyze the species of iodine loaded on the COF adsorbents. In the spectrum of the I$_{2}$-saturated COF-H (Figure S6), weak vibration peaks of ν (I$_{2}$) and ν (I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> ) are observed at 183 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and 117 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively, indicating poor interaction of COF-H towards iodine. In I$_{2}$-sturated COFBmim (Fig. 4d), characteristic bands of 109 and 166 cm GLYPH<0> 1 were observed, which belong to ν $_{s}$(I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> ) and ν (I$_{5}$ GLYPH<0> ), respectively. The bands of ν $_{s}$(I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> ) at 111 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, ν $_{as}$(I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> ) at 133 cm GLYPH<0> 1 and ν (I$_{5}$ GLYPH<0> ) 173 cm GLYPH<0> 1 were observed in I$_{2}$-sturated COF-MC$_{4}$trim in Fig. 4e. The bands of ν $_{s}$(I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> ) at 109 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, ν $_{as}$(I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> ) at 130 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and ν (I$_{5}$ GLYPH<0> ) 172 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$were observed in I$_{2}$sturated COF-AC$_{4}$trim in Fig. 4f. They are quite different from ν (I$_{2}$) at 181 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. It indicates that during the adsorption process, iodine forms

the charge-transfer complex with active moieties of COFs, forming polyiodide ions [49]. XPS analysis was carried out to further explore the chemical species of iodine and the host -guest interactions between COFs and iodine. As displayed high resolution I 3d XPS spectra of I$_{2}$-saturated COF-Bmim in Fig. 4g, the adsorbed iodine exhibited four characteristic peaks at 631.7, 629.6, 620.3 and 618.1 eV, which should be attributed to the signal peaks of I 3d$_{3/2 }$and I 3d$_{5/2 }$of the polyiodide I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> and I$_{5}$ GLYPH<0> ions included in the COF-Bmim. In Fig. 4h, the peaks of I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> , binding energies at 629.3 and 617.8 eV, and that of I$_{5}$ GLYPH<0> , binding energies at 631.8 and 620.2 eV were observed in I$_{2}$-saturated COF-MC$_{4}$trim. In Fig. 4i, the peaks of I$_{3}$ GLYPH<0> , binding energies at 629.1 and 617.5 eV, and that of I$_{5}$ GLYPH<0> , binding energies at 631.3 and 619.7 eV were observed in I$_{2}$-saturated COF-AC$_{4}$trim. In addition, by comparing and analyzing the highresolution XPS spectra of COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim before and after iodine adsorption, evidence of the interaction between the active sites of COF and iodine was found. In Figures S7-S9, it was observed that the peaks representing sulfonic groups and imidazole/ triazole cations showed significant migration [50,51], indicating that iodine interacted with sulfonic groups and IL cations during the adsorption process.

## 3.5. Theoretical modeling analysis

Four corresponding models were constructed based on the structural properties and differences of four types of COFs. From COF-H, COFBmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim to COF-AC$_{4}$trim, the models were named M GLYPH<0> 1, M GLYPH<0> 2, M GLYPH<0> 3, and M GLYPH<0> 4 (see Figure S9). As shown in Figure S11, the electrostatic potential (ESP) mapped molecular vdW surface showed that M GLYPH<0> 2, M GLYPH<0> 3, and M GLYPH<0> 4 exhibited more negative electrostatic potential near the sulfonic group than M GLYPH<0> 1. Moreover, an increase in the polar surface area and internal charge separation was observed in Figures S12 and S13. It indicated that replacing protons with bulk electrophilic cations can ionize sulfonic groups, increase the local polarity of COF, and reduce nearby electrostatic potential energy, which will be beneficial for improving gas adsorption performance. The Reductive Density Gradient (RDG) color-filled isosurface map was employed to reveal the weak interactions between the framework and

Due to the substitution of strong electrophiles, the nucleophilicity index increased from 3.21 eV (M GLYPH<0> 1) to 3.98 eV (M GLYPH<0> 4), and significant improvements were observed in the adsorption capacity and kinetics of COFs. However, continuing to increase the nucleophilicity index to 4.09 eV (M GLYPH<0> 3) and then to 4.17 eV (M GLYPH<0> 2), the adsorption capacity of COF shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing (Fig. 5e). It is not a reasonable trend, so we speculate that other key factors may affect the adsorption performance that has not been discovered yet. Furthermore, it was found that in Fig. 5f, as the nucleophilicity index increased, the molecular polarity index (MPI) of the models did not show a monotonic increasing trend with nucleophilicity but showed abnormality in M GLYPH<0> 4, which seems to coincide with the experimental adsorption results. MPI can quantify local polarity caused by uneven electron cloud distribution characteristics [53]. According to the experimental adsorption capacity of COFs, the corresponding models were arranged from low to high, and the MPI of the models was plotted to obtain Fig. 5g. The results indicate that as the local polarity gradually increases, the experimental adsorption performance of the corresponding COFs also increases, and the two show a positive correlation. Introducing a strong electrophile causes uneven electron cloud distribution of the system and promotes the interaction effect between electron-rich moiety and electrophilic target. We further studied the local polarity and iodine adsorption capacity of reported COF iodine adsorbents, as shown in Figure S14. Local polarity is positively correlated with iodine adsorption capacity, with a linear regression coefficient (R$^{2}$) of 0.8084, indicating a significant correlation between local polarity and COF ' s iodine adsorption capacity [54].

iodine. The filled colors from blue to green and then to red indicate stronger interactions, van der Waals interactions, and greater repulsive effects, respectively [52]. Through RDG analysis (Fig. 5a -d), it was found that M GLYPH<0> 2, M GLYPH<0> 3, and M GLYPH<0> 4 have more weak interaction parts compared with M GLYPH<0> 1, which may be the reason why the adsorption capacity of COF-Bmim, COF-MC$_{4}$trim, and COF-AC$_{4}$trim is much better than that of COF-H.

In addition, the contribution of various parts in the model in the weak interaction with iodine was studied by combining the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) analysis [55,56]. The bond critical point (BCP) between iodine and the models reflects the type and

strength of the interaction. The following topological descriptors described the nature of the bond interaction: the electron density ( ρ $_{BCP}$), the Laplacian of electron density ( $^{$_{∇}$2$_{ρ}$}$$_{BCP}$), the Lagrangian kinetic energy (G$_{BCP}$), and the potential electron density (V$_{BCP}$). The QTAIM analysis results are shown in Figure S15 and Table S4. The results showed that the interaction between deprotonation O atom and iodine contributes the most. In contrast, the interaction strength between protonation O atom and iodine in M GLYPH<0> 1 is less than half of the former. According to the topological criteria, S-O ··· I should belong to the category of halogen bonds, which facilitates the formation of charge transfer complexes [57]. It is speculated that electron-rich oxygen atoms can promote the formation of charge transfer complexes in electrophilic iodine molecules, converting them into polyiodide negative ions. Based on the adsorption mechanism, it is proposed to use carbon dioxide to desorption COF for recycling. At near room temperature, the COF-Bmim that has reached adsorption saturation is treated with carbon dioxide, and the COF-Bmim obtained through desorption still exhibits good adsorption performance (Figure S16).

## 4. Conclusion

In summary, several novel electrophilic ionic-liquid-mediated covalent organic frameworks were prepared using the ILSP method, which exhibited abnormal results during adsorption. Through in-depth research on the COF structure, it unexpectedly discovered an underlying contribution, local polarity. The increase in local polarity led to stronger interaction between the electro-rich site and iodine, and it was observed that there was a positive correlation between local polarity and adsorption performance. The introduction of electrophile can regulate the local polarity of COF, significantly improving its adsorption performance. The saturated adsorption capacity increased from 1.5 to 5.2 g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, and the adsorption kinetics index k$_{80% }$value increased from 0.51 to 2.69 g · g GLYPH<0> $^{1$_{·}$}$h GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. The discovery of contribution of local polarity will provide important fundamental guidance for the precise synthesis of COFs.
