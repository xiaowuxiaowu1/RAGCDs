## ABSTRACT

Biomass electrocatalytic-conversion coupled with hydrogen generation exhibits low energy consumption, efficient hydrogen production and green syntheses of value-added chemicals. However, constructing electrocatalysts with precise electronic modulation and structures for efficient biomass electrocatalytic conversion coupled hydrogen production remains challenging. Herein, a bacterial cellulose substrate was combined in situ with a Mn-doped NiFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursor, and one-step carbonization-phosphorylation was developed for the preparation of Mn-doped nickel iron phosphate (MNFP) embedded in a P, N codoped carbon (PNC) substrate grown directly on P-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (MNFP-PNC/PCBC). Benefiting from the three-dimensional network structure of P-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (PCBC) and atomic doping, MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited an optimized electronic structure, abundant active sites and excellent electrical conductivity. Therefore, the voltages required with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and glucose electrocatalytic-conversion (GCR) to drive a current density of 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$were 0.214, 1.5, and 1.34 V, respectively. Moreover, the required cell voltage of the novel electrolyser containing MNFP-PNC/PCBC as electrodes can be further reduced to 1.55 V at 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$compared to overall water splitting, resulting in more than 8-time improvement in hydrogen production efficiency and production of valueadded formate. This work provides a unique approach for electrocatalytic-conversion of biomass coupled with electrocatalytic hydrogen generation.

## 1. Introduction

Electricity-driven water splitting is one of the most promising strategies for the preparation of high-purity, high-energy -density, green hydrogen, especially using intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy [1 -4]. However, the severe kinetic limitations necessitate the use of efficient electrocatalysts to lower the activation energy and improve the reaction efficiency [5 -7]. To date, noble metalbased catalysts are considered to be the commercially available benchmark catalysts for the above reactions, such as Pt-based and Ru/Ir-based oxides for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively [8 -10]. Unfortunately, electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production is still severely hampered by the inherent high cost, low earth abundance, insufficient catalytic activity, slow kinetics and poor stability of the noble metal catalyst [10 -12]. In

addition, the OER at the anode consumes 90 % of the electrical energy input, and the oxygen produced inevitably mixes with hydrogen, leading to increased energy consumption and risk of water splitting [13 -15]. In recent years, the use of more thermodynamically favorable biomass for electrocatalytic-conversion reactions instead of the OER has significantly improved the efficiency and reduced the energy consumption of hydrogen production [16,17]. In particular, glucose extracted from natural cellulose, which is sustainable and renewable, has a low theoretical potential and can be electrocatalytically converted into a wide range of valuable chemicals [18,19]. For example such as formate, formate has a variety of applications in industries such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, rubber, leather, textiles, food, etc., due to its relative non-corrosiveness, non-toxicity, and ease of biodegradation [20]. Therefore, glucose is undoubtedly one of the most competitive biomasses for catalytic conversion. Since glucose electrocatalytic-

conversion reactions have more complex reaction paths and lower product selectivities, large-scale application coupled with hydrogen production is limited [21]. Therefore, high-activity and high-selectivity electrocatalysts are urgently needed for glucose electrocatalyticconversion so as to couple it with hydrogen generation to achieve high efficiency and low energy consumption for hydrogen production.

enhance the performance of glucose electrocatalytic-conversion coupled with hydrogen production [36].

Herein, PBA-derived Mn-doped nickel -iron phosphate embedded in a P, N co doped carbon substrate and grown directly on the surface of Pdoped CBC (MNFP-PNC/PCBC) was prepared for electrocatalytic glucose conversion coupled with hydrogen production by a one-step carbonization-phosphorylation method using bacterial cellulose as the substrate in situ loaded with Mn-doped NiFe-PBA as the precursor (Scheme 1). The precise electronic modulation and structural design of the MNFP-PNC/PCBC enhanced the intrinsic activity and the number of exposed active sites of the catalyst, and provided excellent electrical conductivity and stability by anchoring the nanoactive materials. Moreover, P doping into the CBC produced carbon defects and optimized the electronic structure of the active centers through interfacial interactions with the Mn-NiFePi and PNC, thereby synergistically improving the performance of glucose electrocatalytic-conversion coupled with hydrogen generation. As a result, MNFP-PNC/PCBC displayed remarkable electrochemical performance with low overpotentials and small Tafel slopes for the HER and OER and excellent durability for water splitting. Moreover, MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic properties for GCR-coupled high-efficiency H$_{2 }$generation; in the presence of glucose, a low potential of only 1.55 V was required to reach a current density 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. Interestingly, this coupled system efficiently generated hydrogen at the cathode, while the increased conversion of glucose at the anode resulted in 97 % glucose conversion with a yield of 79.5 % and a Faraday efficiency of 86.1 % for formate. This work breaks new perspectives for the development highly catalytically active biomass electrocatalytic-conversion coupled hydrogen production electrocatalysts with broad application possibilities through structure engineering and electronic modulation. Specifically, mention that no previously reported NiFe-based electrocatalyst with P-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose as a three-dimensional network substrate loading heteroatom-modulated electronic structures.

## 2.1. Materials

Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O), manganous nitrate (Mn(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$), Trisodium citrate,dihydrate (C$_{6}$H$_{5}$Na$_{3}$O$_{7}$ · 2H$_{2}$O), potassium

Among the current state-of-the-art non precious metal catalysts, NiFe-based electrocatalysts have been developed for the HER, the OER, and even biomass electrocatalytic-conversion, especially nickel -iron phosphates, have undoubtedly proved to be the most promise due to their low costs, tunable electronics and redox properties [22 -24]. However, as with the reported electrocatalysts, their electrocatalytic activity must be further improved to reduce the overall electrical energy required by the electrolyzer and enhanced the hydrogen production efficiency [25]. The electrocatalytic performance is intricately linked to both the exposed active sites and intrinsic activities of these sites [26,27]. Therefore, electrocatalysts with exceptional performance can be constructed through rational surface electronic modulation and structural design. Specifically, the electron-withdrawing or electrondonating centres formed by heteroatom doping (especially cation doping) play key roles in tuning the electronic structures of these electrocatalysts and inducing structural transitions to improve their electrocatalytic performance [28,29]. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are among most promising precursors for the construction of electrocatalysts by virtue of their low costs, convenient syntheses, and tunable compositions [30 -32]. Moreover, doping of heteroatoms into the PBA enables controllable tuning of the composition with a negligible effect on the microscopic morphology, which is favorable for construction of the electrocatalysts [33]. Undesirably, pyrolysis of PBA results in severe microstructural shrinkage and catalyst agglomeration, reducing the exposure of active sites and leading to insufficient electrolyte wettability and reduced stability [33]. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a sustainable and renewable biomaterial with a self-assembled protofibrillar structure and hydrogen bonding network; presenting a three-dimensional network structure with abundant anchoring sites, which is a good substrate for in situ growth of PBA [34,35]. In addition, BC has a high size match with PBA, so PBA is evenly distributed on surface and provides abundant active sites. Carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) maintains a high aspect ratio and three-dimensional structure with excellent electrical conductivity and structural designability, which can significantly

ferricyanide (K$_{3}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$]), sodium hypophosphite (NaH$_{2}$PO$_{2}$ · H$_{2}$O), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., LTD. 5 wt% Nafion solution, 20 wt% platinum on carbon (Pt/C), and RuO$_{2 }$ were purchased from Suzhou Sinero Technology Co., Ltd. Bacterial cellulose (M$_{w }$ = 5.4 × 10$^{5}$) was provided by Hainan Yide Foods Co., Ltd. with 3 mm thick in its wet condition, which was produced by Acetobacter xylinum. A nutrient medium consisting of coconut water, sugar, glacial acetic acid, and citric acid was used to culture the bacteria. They were incubated under static conditions at 28 ℃ for 7 days to obtain BC, and this is the same as previously reported by our group [37].

## 2.2. Synthesis of Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC, Mn-NiFe-PBA and NiFe-PBA

BC was rinsed with deionized water. After that, they were boiled in 0.1 M NaOH solution for 1 h to remove bacterial debris and impurities and then rinsed with deionized water. When the BC became neutral, it was freeze-dried to obtain pure BC for subsequent experiments. For the synthesis of Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC, Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ · 6H$_{2}$O (0.522 g, 1.8 mmol), Mn (NO$_{3}$)$_{2 }$(0.036 g, 0.2 mmol), and C$_{6}$H$_{5}$Na$_{3}$O$_{7}$ · 2H$_{2}$O (0.882 g, 3 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water to form solution A. The solution was then stirred for 2 h with the addition of BC (0.1 g). Potassium ferricyanide (0.658 g, 2 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL deionized water as solution B, which was quickly dropped into solution A, and the mixtures were aged at room temperature for 24 h. The final BC and MnNiFe-PBA composites were washed three times using deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, followed by freeze-drying and labelled as MnNiFe-PBA/BC. As a comparison, Mn-NiFe-PBA was synthesised without the addition of BC, and NiFe-PBA was synthesised without BC addition and with 2 mmol of nickel nitrate, using a modified method analogous to the previously reported [38].

## 2.3. Synthesis of MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC , and PCBC

The MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC, and PCBC were obtained by a chemical vapor deposition hair method, respectively, using a modified method similar to recently reported literature [39]. Typically, the assynthesized Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC and NaH$_{2}$PO$_{2}$ · H$_{2}$O (3 g, 28.5 mmol) were placed downstream and upstream of the tube furnace, respectively. Then, the tube furnace was heated up to 300 · C at a heating rate of 3 · C min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$under nitrogen atmosphere and held for 2 h. Subsequently, it was heated up to 800 · C at a heating rate of 5 · C min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and held for 2 h. After the tube furnace was naturally cooled down to room temperature, MNFP-PNC/PCBC was obtained. MNFP-PNC, and PCBC were synthesised by the same method but with Mn-NiFe-PBA and BC as precursors, respectively.

## 2.4 Synthesis of MNF-NC/CBC, MNFP-NC/CBC, and CBC

The as-synthesized Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC was placed in a tube furnace under nitrogen atmosphere and heated up to 300 · C at a heating rate of 3 · C min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and held for 2 h, then heated up to 800 · C 5 · GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$and held for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, MNFNC/CBC was obtained. CBC were synthesised by the same method but with BC as precursor. For preparation of MNFP-NC/CBC, the assynthesized MNF-NC/CBC and NaH$_{2}$PO$_{2}$ · H$_{2}$O were placed downstream and upstream of the tube furnace, respectively. Then, the tube furnace was heated up to 300 · C at a heating rate of 3 · C min GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$under nitrogen atmosphere and held for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, MNFPNC/CBC was obtained.

## 2.5. Characterization

The morphology of the synthetized electrocatalysts was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while HAADF-STEM images and elemental mapping

of the catalysts were acquired using their equipped EDX modules. The crystal structure of the material was studied on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE using Cu K α radiotracer in the range of 10 · to 80 · at a scan rate of 6 · min GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out in Thermo Scientific. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi. Raman spectra were collected on a THEM DXRxi Raman spectrometer with 532 nm wavelength incident laser light. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was conducted on Bruker Vertex70 spectrometer. The specific surface area of the samples is determined by the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method using on an ASAP 2460 system.

## 2.6. Electrocatalytic experiment

The electrochemical performance of all catalysts with and without glucose in 1 M KOH was tested at room temperature using a standard three-electrode system with a Chenhua CHI760E electrochemical workstation, and electrode preparation and electrochemical testing conditions are described in detail in the Supporting Information.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Characterization of the electrocatalysts

The composition of the Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC precursor was investigated with FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 1a, compared with Mn-NiFe-PBA, the peaks for Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC located at 1055, 1161 (cellulose glycosidic bond), 1427, 2900, and 3450 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$were attributed to the characteristic peak of cellulose [40,41], and the peaks at 3645 cm GLYPH<0> 1 (Fe -CN), 2000 -2200 cm GLYPH<0> 1 (Fe -CN -Ni/Mn), and 600 cm GLYPH<0> 1 (M GLYPH<0> O) were also observed [42,43]. Additionally, XRD data showed that the Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC precursor had the same diffraction peaks at 14.8 · and 22.9 · seen for cellulose (PDF#50 -2241) [36], and peaks for NiFe-PBA (PDF#51 -1897) with 2 theta of 17.9 · , 25.2 · , 35.8 · , 40.1 · , 44.3 · , 44.2 · , 51.4 · , 57.7 · , and 69.3 · were also present (Fig. 1b) [38,44]. Notably, due to the strong adsorption of transition metal ions by the hydroxyl groups on the BC surface and the radius difference between Mn 2 + and Ni 2 + , the XRD characteristic peaks of the as-synthesized MnNiFe-PBA, NiFe-PBA/BC, and Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC underwent a smaller displacement in comparison to NiFe-PBA [33,45]. In addition, all of the precursors exhibited characteristic peaks in the Raman spectra in the range of 2000 -2200 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, which were attributed to the Fe -CN -Ni/Mn (Fig. S1). All of these results proved the successful synthesis of the MnNiFe-PBA/BC precursor.

TEM images showed that MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited a contracted nanoion distribution (orange boxes) on the amorphous carbon framework (white boxes) (Fig. 2c -2e). The accompanying image in Fig. 2c contains selected area electron diffraction (SAED) showing distinct spotand ring-like patterns, demonstrating the polycrystalline structure of

The microscopic morphologies of all precursors and MNFP-PNC/ PCBC were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pure BC presented a threedimensional network structure made of interwoven nanofibrillated cellulose (Fig. 1c -1d), facilitating the anchoring of NiFe-PBA and MnNiFe-PBA, which exhibit a square structure (Fig. S2 and S3). The prepared NiFe-PBA/BC and Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC maintained the square structure of the Prussian blue analogue, which was uniformly distributed in the middle of the BC to form a three-dimensional network structure (Figs. S4, and 1e -1f). After carbonization and phosphorylation, the prepared MNFP-PNC underwent severe agglomeration, which blocked the active sites (Fig. S5). The MNFP-PNC/PCBC prepared with BC as the substrate did not show obvious aggregation and agglomeration (Fig. 2a -2b). Notably, most of the PBA boxes showed some shrinkage in their morphologies, which was attributed to shrinkage of the carbon skeleton due to pyrolysis, resulting in the formation of Mn-doped nickel iron phosphate and P, N co doped carbon.

MNFP-PNC/PCBC. Moreover, the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) image showed lattice streaks with a crystallographic spacing of 0.298 nm attributed to the (210) crystallographic facet of the nickel -iron phosphate, with an amorphous composition of the carbon substrate (Fig. 2f). The TEM elemental distribution map in Fig. 2g verified uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, Mn, N, C, P, and O elements in the MNFP-PNC/ PCBC.

The specific surface areas of MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC, and their precursor were determined by N$_{2 }$adsorption and desorption, and the isotherms are shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S6. The BET surface areas of NiFe-PBA, Mn-NiFe-PBA, and Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC were 28.37, 41.68, and 76.07 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. After one-step carbonization-phosphorylation, the BET specific surface areas of MNFP-PNC and MNFP-PNC/PCBC had decreased to 2.83 and 12.95 m$^{2 }$g GLYPH<0> $^{1}$, respectively. As evidenced by the specific surface area both before and after annealing, the threedimensional network structure of BC provides a large specific surface area for both the precursor and the final catalyst, which facilitates electrolyte wetting and exposure of the catalytically active sites.

The crystal structure and composition of MNFP-PNC/PCBC were characterized with XRD diffraction and the results are displayed in Fig. 3a. The XRD spectrum of MNF-NC/CBC exhibited 2 θ values of 43.9 · , 51.2 · , and 75.1 · for peaks attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of metallic NiFe (PDF#38 -0419) [46], respectively. The peaks for MNFP-PNC/PCBC at 2 θ values of 14.6 · , 19.5 · , 23.5 · , 25.3 · , 26.6 · , 28.2 · , 29.9 · , 31.4 · , 34.8 · , 38.4 · , 40.8 · , 43.3 · , and 44.7 · corresponded to the (0 -11), (1 -11), ( GLYPH<0> 210), ( GLYPH<0> 201), ( GLYPH<0> 220), (0 -12), (210), ( GLYPH<0> 221), (2 -31), ( GLYPH<0> 131), ( GLYPH<0> 302), (1 -42), and (-2 -32) lattice planes of NiFePi (PDF#50 -1772), respectively [47,48], which proved successful construction of the NiFePi in MNFP-PNC/PCBC via one-step carbonization and phosphorylation. In addition, no peaks associated with Mn were observed, indicating that the Mn was doped into the lattice of NiFePi. Furthermore, the XRD spectra of NFP-PNC/PCBC and MNFP-PNC were compared and exhibited diffraction peaks similar to those of MNFP-PNC/PCBC, demonstrating that the in-situ composite conductive substrate and atomic doping did not disrupt the crystal structure of the catalyst.

The surface chemical composition and valence states of the MNFPPNC/PCBC were investigated with XPS. The survey spectrum of MNFP-PNC/PCBC in Fig. S7 shows the presence of Ni, Fe, Mn, O, P, and N, which was consistent with the EDS results. Fig. 3c shows the highresolution Ni 2p spectrum. The deconvoluted peaks at 875.0 eV and 856.9 eV were attributed to Ni 2p$_{1/2 }$and Ni 2p$_{3/2 }$binding energies of

Ni 2 + , while the other two peaks correspond to their satellite peaks [49,50]. In the high-resolution Fe spectrum, the peaks at 711.8 eV and 724.0 eV indicated the binding energies of the Fe 2p$_{3/2 }$ and Fe 2p$_{1/2 }$ states of Fe 3 + , the peak at 709.4 eV was attributed to the Fe 2p$_{3/2 }$state for Fe 2 + , while the peaks centred at 715.8 eV and 727.3 eV were Fe 2p$_{3/2 }$ and Fe 2p$_{1/2 }$satellites (Fig. 3d) [51]. Furthermore, the peak at 856.9 eV for the 2p$_{3/2 }$state of Ni 2 + and at 711.8 eV for the 2p$_{3/2 }$state of Fe 3 + in MNFP-PNC/PCBC were shifted positively by 0.4 eV and 0.3 eV, respectively, compared with those of NFP-PNC/PCBC, which sufficiently confirmed that doping with Mn changed the electron cloud densities around the Ni and Fe sites, resulting in optimization of their electronic structures [52]. For the Mn 2p high-resolution spectrum shown in Fig. 3e, the two peaks at 641.5 eV and 653.4 eV were assigned to the Mn 2p$_{3/2 }$and Mn 2p$_{1/2 }$states, where the Mn 2p$_{3/2 }$peaks was deconvoluted to give the peaks at 641.5 eV and 644.4 eV, confirming the presence of Mn 3 + and Mn 4 + [7,53].The high-resolution spectrum of C 1 s shown in Fig. 3f for MNFP-PNC/PCBC was deconvoluted into four peaks at 287.6 eV, 286.6 eV, 285.6 eV, and 284.8 eV attributed to the O-C = O, C-N, CP, and C -C/C = C species, respectively, demonstrating the formation of P, N codoped carbon. The high-resolution N 1 s spectrum in Fig. 3g demonstrated that the doped N elements were mainly present in the carbonaceous substrate in the form of graphitic N (400.7 eV), pyrrolic N (399.3 eV) and pyridine N (397.7 eV). In addition, the high-resolution P 2p spectrum further demonstrated the formation of NiFePi and P-doped C substrates (Fig. 3h). For comparison, the XPS spectra of MNF-NC/CBC, MNFP-NC/CBC and NFP-PNC/PCBC are shown in Fig. S8 -S11. In particular, no C-P bonds were indicated in the C 1 s and P 2p spectra of MNFP-NC/CBC. Furthermore, in the presence of the Mn dopant and the heteroatom P alone, the binding energies of the Fe and Ni sites were shifted to different extents, demonstrating modulation of the electron cloud density at the active centers. Previous studies showed that the electronic structure and indicated properties of the C substrate could be modulated by P doping to optimize the electronic interactions between the carrier and the active material [54]. This synergistic effect on modulation of the electronic structure of the substrate and the active centres significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic glucose conversion coupled hydrogen production process. Raman spectra of MNFP-PNC/ PCBC, MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, and CBC were obtained to further investigate the carbon substrates. Two characteristic peaks at ~ 1350 and ~ 1580 cm GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$were observed in all the samples that correspond to the D and G bands of the porous carbon matrix, respectively. Usually, the D band represents the disordered sp$^{3 }$carbon, whereas the G band

reflects the sp$^{2 }$type graphitic carbon. Furthermore, the graphitization degree and defect density of carbon-based materials can be estimated by calculating the intensity ratio (I$_{D}$/I$_{G}$) of the D and G bands. The calculated I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$values from the Raman spectra showed in Fig. 3i were found to be 1.08, 1.02, 0.92, and 0.85 for MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, and CBC. Interestingly, the ID/IG values of as-prepared electrocatalysts increased with introducing the heteroatom, plausibly due to the promotive effect of P and N in the formation of disordered carbon during the carbonization reaction. Furthermore, the comparatively higher I$_{D}$/I$_{G }$value of MNFP-PNC/PCBC electrocatalyst compared to the others electrocatalyst to the presence of higher number of defect

sites especially the disordered/nongraphitic carbon in the MNFP-PNC/ PCBC. Such defect sites are known to be beneficial to enhance the HER, OER, and GCR activity. (Fig. 3i) [55 -57].

## 3.2. HER performance

The HER electrocatalytic performances of the as-prepared electrocatalysts were investigated with a typical three-electrode system in 1 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S12, the polarization curves confirmed the excellent HER activities of MNFPPNC/PCBC at different current densities. The commercial Pt/C

electrocatalysts are recognized as the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts and exhibit first-rank HER electrocatalytic activity at lower current densities, with overpotentials of 134 and 217 mV required for current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, respectively, whereas the required overpotential was 360 mV when the current density was increased to 200 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$. Notably, the MNFP-PNC/PCBC electrocatalyst exhibited remarkable HER performance with low overpotentials of 214, 255, and 288 mV to reach current densities of 50, 100, and 200 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, respectively. These results were significantly better than those of other as-prepared electrocatalysts, such as MNFP-NC/CBC (328, 396, and 494 mV), MNF-NC/CBC (357, 452, and 600 mV), NFP-PNC/PCBC (251, 296, and 356 mV), and MNFP-PNC (305, 356, and 423 mV). Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic properties of MNFP-PNC/PCBC can be well regulated with varied amount of Mn doping (Fig. S13). Furthermore, the kinetics of the HER can be evaluated by the Tafel slope, which can be calculated from the LSVs. MNFP-PNC/PCBC displayed a Tafel slope of 109 mV dec -$^{1}$, which was close to Pt/C (75 mV dec -$^{1}$) and obviously smaller than those of MNFP-NC/CBC (201 mV dec -$^{1}$), MNFNC/CBC (208 mV dec -$^{1}$), NFP-PNC/PCBC (159 mV dec -$^{1}$), and MNFPPNC (178 mV dec -$^{1}$), indicating that MNFP-PNC/PCBC displayed a smaller electron transfer barrier, resulting in a faster HER kinetic of MNFP-PNC/PCBC and more probability Heyrovsky-Volmer hydrogen production mechanism (Fig. 4b). The charge transfer resistance (R$_{ct}$) of all catalysts was determined using electrochemical impedance

spectroscopy (EIS) with a measured overpotential of 180 mV to deeply investigate the catalytic activity of HER. The EIS spectra of MNFP-PNC/ PCBC, MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, and MNFP-PNC were fitted with the equivalent circuit (insert in Fig. 4c), and the results are shown in Fig. 4c. It can be observed that MNFP-PNC/PCBC had the lowest R$_{ct }$of 2.36 Ω , while the R$_{ct }$values of MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/ CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC, and Pt/C were 13.81, 15.07, 6.01, 3.43, and 3.73 Ω respectively, revealing MNFP-PNC/PCBC is equipped with a higher conductivity and faster charge transfer rate at interface between the electrolyte and electrode. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of an electrocatalyst is the primary means of determining its high catalytic activity, which was evaluated by measuring the double layer capacitance (C$_{dl}$) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S14) [2]. The calculated values of C$_{dl }$for MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC, and Pt/C were 10.1, 2.7, 2.3, 5.5, 4.3, and 7.6 mF cm GLYPH<0> 2 , respectively (Fig. 4d). It is clear observed that MNFP-PNC/PCBC had the largest C$_{dl}$, demonstrably proving that it provided more active sites for the HER and increased H$_{2 }$ production, and implied that the use of bacterial cellulose-derived carbon fibers as a substrate contributed to the increase in active sites. Moreover, the turnover frequencies (TOFs) of MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFPNC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, and MNFP-PNC on HER were calculated and compared to explore the effect of Mn atom doping and subtle structural engineering on the catalyst intrinsic HER activity.

shown in Fig. S15, the TOF of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was higher than that of MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, and MNFP-PNC for the same potential. Overall, the intrinsic HER activity was higher than that of the other electrocatalysts. In addition, the stability of the electrocatalyst is one of the essential parameters. The cycling durability and long-term stability of the electrocatalysts were obtained by testing the CV and chronoamperometry of the electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 4e, after 3000 CV-accelerated cycling measurements, the polarization curves of MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited only a very weak negative HER shift. In addition, the long-term stability of MNFP-PNC/ PCBC is shown in the inset of Fig. 4e, which confirms that there was no significant degradation after 100 h tests in 1 M KOH at a current of 100 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, demonstrating the electrocatalyst ' s excellent stability and durability. Structural characterization after HER tests further confirmed that the crystal structure and electronic structure of MNFP-PNC/PCBC remained almost unaltered, implying that MNFP-PNC/PCBC has a strong structural robustness (Fig. S16 and S17). In particular, owing to the synergistic effect of the precisely tuned electronic structure, defect induction by the P, N codoped carbon and PCBC anchoring, the asprepared MNFP-PNC/PCBC electrocatalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance and stability and outperformed reported non precious metal electrocatalysts (Fig. 4f).

## 3.3. OER performance

The OER electrocatalytic performance of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was assessed in a 1 M KOH electrolyte with a typical three-electrode system, which had the same electrode configuration as that used to measure the HER activity, except that a Pt plate was used as the counter electrode instead of a graphite rod. To activate and stabilize the MNFP-PNC/PCBC electrode, CV scans were conducted from 0.9 V to 1.8 V (vs. RHE) with a scan rate of 0.1 V s GLYPH<0> $^{1}$. For comparison, the electrocatalytic performance of MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC, and RuO$_{2 }$ was tested under the same conditions, and polarization curves are shown in Fig. 5a, and Fig. S18 demonstrates the relevant overpotentials of the catalysts at different current densities. As shown in Fig. 5a, the required overpotentials for MNFP-PNC/PCBC were

only 270, 291, and 307 mV at 50, 100, and 200 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, respectively, which were significantly smaller than those of MNFP-NC/CBC (332, 378, and 455 mV), MNF-NC/CBC (359, 411, and 474 mV), NFP-PNC/ PCBC (291, 314, and 348 mV), MNFP-PNC (312, 344, and 392 mV) and commercial RuO$_{2 }$ (357, 455, and 607 mV) at the same current densities. In addition, the OER performance of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was also superior to its counterparts with different amounts of Mn doping (Fig. S19). Moreover, the OER performance of the fabricated electrocatalysts followed the order of MNFP-PNC/PCBC > NFP-PNC/PCBC > MNFP-PNC > MNFP-NC/CBC > MNF-NC/CBC, indicating that dopants, carbon defect, and the PCBC played crucial roles in enhancing the OER property. The OER kinetics of these samples as shown in Fig. 5b were assessed by calculating the Tafel slope obtained by LSV. MNFP-PNC/ PCBC exhibited a smaller Tafel slope (54 mV dec -$^{1}$) than NFP-PNC/ PCBC (66 mV dec -$^{1}$), MNFP-PNC (80 mV dec -$^{1}$), MNFP-NC/CBC (100 mV dec -$^{1}$), MNF-NC/CBC (118 mV dec -$^{1}$), and RuO$_{2 }$ (112 mV dec -$^{1}$), demonstrating that MNFP-PNC/PCBC had remarkable OER kinetics. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) obtained at 240 mV overpotential as shown in Fig. 5c were used to further determine the OER kinetics of the electrocatalyst. All of the electrocatalysts exhibited similar solution resistances (R$_{s}$), while MNFP-PNC/PCBC showed a charge transfer resistance (R$_{ct}$) of 2.29 Ω , which was significantly smaller than those of MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC, and RuO$_{2}$. The small R$_{ct }$ value indicated faster charge transfer between the electrocatalyst and electrolyte with excellent kinetics, consistent with the results of Tafel slope, further suggesting that the electronic structure of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was optimized. The electrocatalytic activities were further analyzed with an electrochemical double layer capacitor (C$_{dl}$), as shown in Fig. 5d and S20. The C$_{dl }$values of MNFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, MNFP-PNC, and RuO$_{2 }$were 13.0, 4.9, 4.2, 9.1, 6.5, and 6.1 mF cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, respectively, implying that the bacterial cellulose-derived carbon fibers provide a more active surface for the Mn- NFP-PNC/PCBC, providing a three-dimensional network structure with an enlarged electrochemically active surface, exposing more active sites. Moreover, the TOF of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was higher than that of MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/ CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, and MNFP-PNC at the same potential (Fig. S21),

suggesting that the the doping of Mn atoms and the interfacial structure induced by the anchoring effect of the bacterial cellulose-derived carbon fibers enhanced the intrinsic OER activity of the electrocatalyst. In addition, the MNFP-PNC/PCBC retained the electrocatalytic activity intact after continuous operation for more than 100 h as detected by the chronoamperometry, and its current density did not undergo a significant decay (Fig. 5e). In addition, the XRD patterns of MNFP-PNC/PCBC after OER showed only minor changes, indicating the overall stability of its crystal structure (Fig. S22). Furthermore, XPS characterizes the surface chemical state of the real reaction catalyst before and after the reaction. As shown in Fig. Fig. S23a, the Ni 2p peaks were located at 856.77 eV, 875.17 eV, and 859.67 eV, belonging to 2p$_{3/2}$, 2p$_{1/2 }$of Ni 2 + , and 2p$_{3/2 }$ of Ni 3 + , respectively, and the corresponding satellite peaks were located at 862.07 and 880.47 eV. The results indicated that the Ni 2 + of the MNFP-PNC/PCBC in the OER process was partially electrooxidized to Ni 3 + , and NiOOH was considered as the OER active site. After the OER test, the peak of Fe 2p$_{3/2 }$at 711.97 eV was significantly positively shifted, indicating that the surface Fe species were oxidized to form high valence states after the OER test (Fig. S23b). The chemical state of Mn element as dopant did not change significantly before and after the OER reaction (Fig. S23c). Fig. 5f shows that MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibits superior OER performance to most recently reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH. The results indicate that MNFP-PNC/PCBC has excellent HER and OER performance. Therefore, a two-electrode electrolyzer was fabricated to evaluate its performance as

a bifunctional electrocatalyst for electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen in alkaline media using MNFP-PNC/PCBC as both cathode and anode. As a comparison, two commercial catalysts, Pt/C and RuO$_{2}$, were used to construct a two-electrode electrolyzer and tested under the same conditions. Notably, MNFP-PNC/PCBC displayed impressive electrochemical activity with a voltage of 1.783 V reaching current of 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, which was similar to that of commercial Pt/C and RuO$_{2 }$(1.788 V) (Fig. 5). The stability of the electrocatalyst was monitored by chronoamperometry, and the results showed that the MNFP-PNC/PCBC was remarkably robust, with negligible attenuation for more than 300 h continuous operation (Fig. 5h). In addition, the Faraday efficiency was explored by comparing the amount of gases collected in the experiments with the theoretical amount, where oxygen (O$_{2}$) and hydrogen (H$_{2}$) produced by electrolysis of water were collected by the drainage method. The volume ratio of collected O$_{2 }$and H$_{2 }$was 1.95:1, which is close to the theoretical value of 2:1. Furthermore, Fig. 5i shows that the Faraday efficiency (FE) of the MNFP-PNC/PCBC device was about 98.4 %, which indicates that H$_{2 }$ and O$_{2 }$ are the main products formed by consuming electrical energy rather than other by-products generated through redox reactions. These results indicate that the unique electronic states and carefully constructed open channels of MNFP-PNC/ PCBC accelerate the penetration of electrolyte and desorption of the generated gases, and improve the efficiency of hydrogen production by water electrolysis. MNFP-PNC/PCBC possesses an excellent hydrogen production performance by water electrolysis, which outperforms most

Separation and Purification Technology 343 (2024) 127178 Wei et al.

of the recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts, implying that MNFP-PNC/PCBC as a non-precious metal catalyst is a highperformance and stable sustainable electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from water electrolysis.

## 3.4. GCR performance

Replacing OER with GCR not only improves hydrogen production efficiency but also generates high value-added chemicals by electrocatalytic conversion of glucose at the anode. The possibility of MNFPPNC/PCBC as a potential catalyst for glucose electrocatalysis was explored in 1 M KOH with 50 mM glucose. Fig. 6a shows the OER and GCR polarization curves for MNFP-PNC/PCBC with and without 50 mM glucose in the 1 M KOH. In the absence of glucose, MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited remarkable OER electrocatalytic activity and required only 1.5 V to drive a 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$current density. In the presence of glucose, the potential required to deliver the same current density was significantly reduced to 1.34 V. Compared with OER, GCR showed advantageous electrical energy output at different current densities, implying that the GCR was preferable to the OER (Fig. 6b). Additionally, the MNFP-PNC/PCBC electrocatalyst showed the smallest overpotential required for glucose conversion to drive a current density of 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> 2 compared to MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, and MNFP-PNC (Fig. 6c). Moreover, the TOF of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was higher than that of MNFP-NC/CBC, MNF-NC/CBC, NFP-PNC/PCBC, and

MNFP-PNC at the same potential (Fig. S24), suggesting that the the doping of Mn atoms and the interfacial structure induced by the anchoring effect of the bacterial cellulose-derived carbon fibers enhanced the intrinsic GCR activity of the electrocatalyst. GCR kinetics were evaluated by Tafel slopes for these samples as shown in Fig. 6d, which were calculated from LSV. MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited a smaller Tafel slope (51 mV dec -$^{1}$) than NFP-PNC/PCBC (61 mV dec -$^{1}$), MNFPPNC (74 mV dec -$^{1}$), MNFP-NC/CBC (99 mV dec -$^{1}$), and MNF-NC/CBC (132 mV dec -$^{1}$), demonstrating that MNFP-PNC/PCBC had favorable GCR kinetics [58]. The interfacial properties between the MNFP-PNC/ PCBC electrode and the electrolyte were investigated using operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which revealed the mechanism of the GCR process and verified the enhancement of the GCR activity (Fig. 6e -6f). The charge transfer process occurring at the electrocatalyst-electrolyte interface was characterized using semicircle diameters in Nyquist plots and frequencies and phase angles in Bode plots [59]. In the Bode plot of OER, MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibits obvious low-frequency characteristic peaks when the voltage exceeds 1.40 V, implying a strong OH adsorption capacity. Undoubtedly, the CGRrelated characteristic peaks displayed by MNFP-PNC/PCBC in the midfrequency region are completely different from those observed during the OER process. As the voltage increases, the corresponding frequency changes and the peak shifts to a lower phase angle, demonstrating that the phase angle is determined by the adsorption capacity of glucose and OH on the electrode surface. However, when the voltage was increased

to 1.55 V, peaks associated with OER appeared at lower frequencies. This is due to the fact that the local glucose concentration around the electrode decreases as the voltage increases, results in the hydroxides generated on the surface of MNFP-PNC/PCBC provide OH -, which promotes the oxygen evolution [60].

Furthermore, periodic electrochemical measurements were conducted with MNFP-PNC/PCBC in 1 M KOH, both with and without 50 mM glucose, to confirm the active sites for the GCR, and the results are displayed in Fig. 6g -6i. In 1 M KOH, MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited small positive and negative currents at 0 ~ 100 s and 200 ~ 300 s, respectively, representing its electrooxidative and electroreductive processes, implying that NiOOH (Ni 3 + ) is the active site of OER. In the presence of glucose, MNFP-PNC/PCBC provided a high current density of 125 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$in the GCR process from 0 ~ 100 s, while there was no reduction current from 200 ~ 300 s. The current density of MNFP-PNC/PCBC in the GCR run from 0 ~ 100 s was higher than that of MNFP-PNC/PCBC. In addition, an oxidation current of 1 M KOH was detected by applying an anodic voltage, which was associated with the formation of NiOOH from Ni(OH)$_{2 }$ [61]. Glucose was injected in the open circuit state. Subsequently, a cathodic potential of 1.0 V (vs. RHE) was applied to the catalyst and no reduction current was observed. The results showed that no reduction current was observed due to the spontaneous conversion of NiOOH generated at the anode to Ni(OH)$_{2 }$by glucose reduction in the open-circuit state during the electrocatalytic conversion of glucose.

## 3.5. Glucose electrocatalytic conversion coupled with H$_{2 }$ production performance

Since MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for the HER, OER and GCR, a hybrid electrolyzer was assembled with MNFP-PNC/PCBC as both the anode and cathode to further explore the property of glucose electrocatalytic-conversion coupled to hydrogen production. Consequently, the glucose conversion-coupled with high-efficiency hydrogen production device was constructed using MNFP-PNC/PCBC as anode and cathode, and its model diagram is shown in Fig. 7a. Fig. 7b showed the comparison

between the performance of the novel hydrogen production device and the original water splitting. As expected, the glucose-assisted electrolysis system showed very high hydrogen production performance with overpotentials of only 1.50 V and 1.55 V to reach current densities of 25 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$and 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2}$, while the overall water splitting drives the same current densities with the required voltages of 1.71 V and 1.78 V, which implies that glucose electrocatalytic conversion coupled with HER was more electrocatalytically active enhanced electrocatalytic activity than that of conventional water electrolysis. Fig. 7c displayed the corresponding potentials of MNFP-PNC/PCBC at different current densities with and without 50 mM glucose in 1 M KOH, and the results indicate that the overpotentials of all the novel electrolyzed water-tohydrogen devices are lower than those required for conventional electrolysis of water, implying that the efficiency of the device for glucose electrocatalytic conversion coupled to hydrogen production is significantly superior to that of the water cracking device. Subsequently, the recyclability of the glucose electrocatalytic conversion coupled with hydrogen production system was tested by the chronoamperometry to verify the effectiveness of MNFP-PNC/PCBC as a catalyst for glucose electrocatalytic conversion coupled with hydrogen production (Fig. 7d). After prolonged electrolysis, glucose was almost completely converted to high value-added chemistry and the current density was reduced to the initial state. Subsequent replacement of the electrolyte returned the device to the glucose electrocatalytic conversion coupled hydrogen production process. During continuous electrolysis, the hydrogen generated at the cathode was collected using the drain method and compared with the theoretical hydrogen generation, and the FE of the device was found to be 98.5 %. In addition, the system achieved a high hydrogen production efficiency of 0.916 mmol h GLYPH<0> $^{1 }$at 1.55 V, which is eight times higher than that of conventional electrolytic water splitting (Fig. 7e). The products of the electrocatalytic process were characterized and quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectroscopy ($^{1}$H NMR) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The electrolyte was collected and the concentrations of substrates, intermediates, and products in the continuous electrolysis process at 1.45 V were quantified by  $^{1}$H NMR. Formate was proved to be the main

product of the electrocatalytic process as shown in Fig. S25. Glucose conversion and formate yield were calculated from standard curves (Fig. S26 -S27).

The above results demonstrated that the prepared MNFP-PNC/PCBC electrocatalysts exhibit efficient water splitting performance for hydrogen production. The main mechanisms include the following: (i) The introduction of P doped bacterial cellulose-derived carbon fibers with abundant defects improved the overall electrical conductivity of the catalysts, reduced the aggregation of PBAs-derived nanoparticles, constructed electrocatalysts with a three-dimensional network structure, and increased the number of active sites exposed by the electrocatalysts. (ii) Elemental doping induced more electrons transferred from Mn sites to Ni or Fe sites, optimized their electronic structure, and accelerated electron transfer. (iii) In addition, the synergistic effect of electron modulation and structure engineering further optimized the electronic structure of the surface interface of the electrocatalysts, which resulted in the MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibiting excellent HER, OER, GCR, and overall water splitting electrocatalytic activity and stability (Fig. 8).

The mixed electrolyte was characterized and the results showed that formic acid was the main product. As shown in Fig. 7f, the MNFP-PNC/ PCBC exhibited excellent electrocatalytic conversion performance for glucose, with 97 % glucose conversion, 79.5 % formic acid yield and 86.1 % FE after 24 h of electrolysis. Five consecutive electrolysis experiments were used to verify the stability and reusability of the MNFPPNC/PCBC bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalytic conversion of glucose to hydrogen and to determine the glucose conversion, electrocatalytic product yield and Faraday efficiency. The results showed that after repeated electrolyte changes and completion of the electrocatalytic conversion, MNFP-PNC/PCBC still maintained a high conversion (97 %), a high formate yield (79.2 %) and a high FE (85.8 %), implying that the MNFP-PNC/PCBC has excellent cyclic stability. In order to further understand the GCR effect of MNFP-PNC/PCBC catalysts, the crystal structure and surface chemical composition of MNFP-PNC/PCBC after GCR were further investigated using XRD and XPS. As shown in Fig. S28, the crystal structure of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was almost completely preserved after GCR, implying that MNFP-PNC/PCBC has good crystal stability in GCR. In addition, the chemical composition was not significantly changed (Fig. S29), which is consistent with the results of the periodic electrochemical measurements, suggesting that the GCR reaction of MNFP-PNC/PCBC involves two concomitant processes, including the reversible redox transformation of Ni(OH)$_{2 }$ (Ni 2 + )/NiOOH (Ni 3 + ) and the electrocatalytic GCR [62,63]. Notably, the electrolyzer operated using the GCR process rather than the OER process exhibited highly efficient hydrogen production at lower voltages and produced valueadded chemicals, and it could be reused for more than five cycles with high Faraday hydrogen production efficiency (Fig. S30).

## 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, Mn-NiFePi nanoparticles with P, N codoped carbon anchored on the surface of P-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose were prepared by pyrolysis of a Mn-NiFe-PBA/BC precursor via in a one-step carbonization-phosphorylation process. The surface electronic structure of MNFP-PNC/PCBC was synergistically optimized by using Mn as a dopant in combination with defects induced by the P-doped carbon. In addition, the PCBC improved the electrical conductivity and provided anchoring sites that enhanced the active sites of the electrocatalyst. This synergistic effect resulted in excellent HER, OER and GCR electrocatalytic activities and stability for MNFP-PNC/PCBC. The voltage required at 50 mA cm GLYPH<0> $^{2 }$in the operation of a new electrolyzer with GCR instead of OER can be further reduced from 1.78 V to 1.55 V, which significantly reduces the energy consumption of hydrogen production at higher current densities, and an 8 times higher hydrogen production rate was achieved with conventional electrolyzed water, as well as high value-added formate was produced at the anode with a yield of 79.5 %. This construction of a bacterial cellulose-based electrocatalyst provides

theoretical guidance and technical support enabling efficient hydrogen production and a sustainable supply of industrial chemicals, thus paving the way for rational design of renewable biomass-based and scalable nanoelectrocatalysts for biomass catalytic conversion coupled to hydrogen production.
