You are a query rewriter tasked with rewriting the given #Query# into a more complex version.
The goal is to make the query more ambiguous and harder to directly match with the original context, thus increasing the chances of matching with other contexts.At the same time, it should be more challenging for powerful models (like gpt-4o) to answer the query.However, the modified query must still be fully answerable using the context, and it must be semantically clear, easy to understand, and explicitly target the required answer.The query should be precise and specific, asking about processes, terms, numbers, or specific information, and prefer using 'what' questions, though 'how' may also be used when necessary.You must avoid creating unanswerable queries.
Please follow the steps below to rewrite the given '#Query#' into a more complex version.
Step 1: - Analyze the query components to identify which parts can be abstracted or rephrased to be more ambiguous.
- Use synonyms or alternate descriptions for key terms to present the information differently.
- Integrate indirect references or comparative language to increase complexity.
- Add layers of conditions or context switches, ensuring the query still relates back to and can be fully answered by the context.
- Encourage multifaceted questions by combining multiple related aspects into a single query.
- Leverage hypothetical scenarios or analogies to frame the question in a novel way.
- Ensure the query strikes a balance between complexity and answerability by verifying against the context.

Step 2: - Begin by dissecting the original query into its fundamental elements: subject, process, and comparison.
- Apply methods from the list to each element, focusing on abstraction and rewording.
- Develop multiple possibilities for rephrasing using synonyms, indirect language, and context layers.
- Draft a combined query that integrates these changes, ensuring it maintains clarity and specificity.
- Cross-reference with the context to ensure answerability and to avoid creating an unanswerable question.
- Iterate over the draft query to refine and increase the level of abstract complexity without losing connection to the context.

Step N-2:
#Rewritten Query#
- Start by rewording the subject matter to include indirect references or substitutions.
- Reconstruct the comparative aspect, introducing hypotheticals or analogies to shift direct language.
- Integrate conditions that require analysis of both mentioned processes, using indirect descriptions.
- Compile the alterations into a cohesive query that still aligns with the original intent.

Step N-1:
#Verified Query#
- Check that the newly structured query can be fully answered using the given context by matching each query segment to relevant parts of the context.
- Ensure no part of the query falls outside the scope of the provided information.
- Validate the final queryâ€™s clarity and precision, confirming it retains semantic integrity while being more abstract.

Step N:
#Finally Rewritten Query#
- Assemble the abstracted and refined elements into the final query version.
- Ensure it invites deeper analysis and broader interpretation, aligning with the context without being misconstrued.
- Finalize by confirming that all components of the query can be directly linked back to the context for a coherent answer.
#Query#: 
{query}
#context#: 
{context}
Remember, your task is to generate a more complex version of the query, not to answer the #Query#.
The #Finally Rewritten Query# should be harder to match directly with the original context, but it must still be answerable using the context.
