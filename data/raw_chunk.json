Introduction\n\nLong afterglow luminescence is a special optical phenomenon. Corresponding products can continue to emit light for some time after excitation has ceased, due to electrons being excited and stored in the trap and subsequently released slowly by thermal energy at room temperature [1 -4]. Long afterglow phosphor has been widely used in emergency lighting and displays, decoration, optical information storage, in vivo bio-imaging night vision monitoring, etc [5 -8]. For long afterglow phosphors, emitting centers and traps are two decisive factors worth considering [9,10]. Usually, the emitting center serves as the destination of the release carrier that generates the emission.",

Such structure may provide defect conditions for the design of long afterglow phosphors. It was indeed found that Bi 3 + presents long afterglow luminescence in the structure. But the long afterglow luminescence of rare earth in the system has never been reported before. Moreover, another structure merit is that the [A/BO$_{9}$] polyhedrons in different layers are well separated by the interlayer [CO$_{6}$] polyhedrons, thus if the activator were in the A/B site, the luminescence quenching effect may be restrained.",

Unfortunately, TC cannot be fully absorbed in the bodies of humans or animals, and a significant portion is discharged into aquatic environments through metabolism [2]. Due to its significant ecological toxicity, even trace amounts of residual TC in water can pose substantial risks to aquatic ecosystems [3,4]. Furthermore, TC and its derivatives possess relatively stable structures, typically resistant to natural or biological degradation [5]. So, the quest for a rapid method to eliminate TC from water is of paramount importance.\n\nAdvanced oxidation processes based on persulfate (SR-AOPs) are considered effective techniques for the removal of TC and other recalcitrant organic pollutants from water bodies [6,7].",

So, to achieve the efficient degradation of pollutants in saline environments, it is necessary to introduce other PMS activation pathways to biochar materials.

Co-doping with iron and nitrogen seems to offer a solution to the problems of subpar performance and activation pathways in biochar.

Factors affecting performance of the catalyst\n\nTo investigate the reasons behind the exceptional catalytic performance of FSBC, we examined the correlation of TC degradation rate constants with various factors that may affect FSBC performance.

Although iron and nitrogen might not directly partake in the reaction, their role cannot be disregarded.

Since the surface energy of the oil phase is usually lower than that of the water phase, even if the surface of a hydrophilic modified membrane is wetted, once an oil phase breaks through the hydration layer, and direct contact with the membrane also will quickly wet its surface [11,12]. Importantly, the strength of the hydration layer determines the oil resistance of the membrane surface, which is fundamentally based on forming an oil-resistant barrier by tightly binding water molecules through hydrogen bonds [13].",

LRC, which usually includes lignite and non-stick coal, plays an important role in global energy supply and chemical production [1, 2]. LRC belongs to low metamorphic coal, indicating that it contains abundant hydrophilic functional groups, strong hydrophilicity,\n\nand many surface pores [1]. Therefore, froth flotation is a common beneficiation method for LRC, which uses different surface properties to separate minerals. However, the hydrophobic properties of the mineral of interest affect its separation performance [3].",

In the case of LRC, the surface characteristics favor interactions between water molecules and hydrophilic surface sites, thus forming a hydration layer, preventing coal particles from adhering to bubbles and reducing hydrophobicity [4], and this seriously affects the flotation of LRC. Therefore, in order to obtain better flotation efficiency of LRC, a range of treatment processes have been proposed, such as pyrolysis, flotation pretreatment, and the use of flotation agents [5-7]. For example, the use of microwave radiation successfully increased the fixed carbon content and combustion calorific value of the LRC [7, 8].",

Thus, the ions in water resources have a key effect on mineral separation via froth flotation. In fact, in the early 1930s, it was found that the use of salt solutions can promote the flotation of hydrophobic mineral particles. This phenomenon has been concerned and studied by scholars. Some scholars have put forward several theories to explain this phenomenon [9-11, 16-19].",

For example, the electrolyte ions can disrupt the hydration layer on the particle surface, thus enhancing the bubble's capture of the particles, reducing electrostatic interactions, and enhancing the charge on the bubble surface to hinder bubble coalescence.",

For example, the combination of 4-methyl-2-amyl alcohol and salt ions has been shown to produce more stable foams and reduce concentrate recovery, whereas the combination of diesel oil and salt ions reduces the ash content [35]. In addition, since fine mineral particles possess large specific surface areas, the increase in cation concentration compresses the double electric layer around the particles [36, 37].\n\nAs mentioned, inorganic salts can inhibit the flotation effect of hydrophobic particles.

COAs and pH conditions affect the transport of 2-APA enantiomeric pairs\n\nIn general, the pH conditions provide the most significant effect on the transport of solutes, which involves the alteration of the surface charge of solutes [44]. Since altered pH affect the charge of solutes, which depends on the dissociation constant, this drives variation in the transport of the solute via electrostatic interactions [35]. The 2-APA enantiomeric pairs were mainly in molecular form at pH = 3, whereas with increasing pH, the 2-APA enantiomers were predominantly in anionic form [10].",

Meanwhile, the report pointed out that choices and actions taken within the next decade will significantly impact the present and future for thousands of years, emphasizing the need to strengthen climate action immediately.

Introduction\n\nIn recent years, single-atom catalysts (SACs) loaded with nitrogendoped carbon (NC) materials have shown excellent electrocatalytic performance in improving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode side of fuel cells and metal-air batteries [1 -6]; these materials are expected to solve the problems of scarce resources, high cost and inadequate stability of current commercial Pt-based catalysts [7 -9]. However, an isolated active site of SACs determines a fixed adsorption pattern, whereas the adsorption energies of intermediates of a multi-step reaction connected to an individual metal site are interrelated [10 -15]. Optimally regulating the adsorption and desorption of each reaction intermediate at an individual active site simultaneously for a given multi-step reaction is extremely difficult [16 -19].",

Compared with the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen, electrolysis of seawater for raw material requirements are lower and more widely used.

This study demonstrates a construction of heterogeneous structure based on Co ions as an efficient multifunctional catalyst for overall seawater splitting and urea oxidation.

In this regard, developing efficient electrocatalysts possessing sufficient water and proton adsorption sites is essential to the substantial advance of HER.

However, their size influence on the enhancement of chloride binding is still a research gap, enormously hindering the further employment of CDs toward cement system. Herein, their size-induced effect on chloride binding actions of cement is comprehensively unveiled using CDs with various sizes for the first time. Specifically, three kinds of CDs with different sizes are controllably prepared through simply altering the calcinating time of citric acid. And the relationship between sizes of CDs and chloride binding capacity of cement is confirmed through the equilibrium tests. More importantly, the mechanism for the effect of CDs sizes on chloride binding is reasonably proposed according to the alteration analyses of phase compositions.",

This testifies that the chloride binding capacity of CDs-incorporated cement is negatively correlative with CDs sizes. The related mechanism is that CDs with smaller sizes can provide more nucleation sites to promote cement hydration, further advancing the production of C -S -H gels and monosulfate (Ms), thus more markedly enhancing the physical adsorption and chemical binding of chloride ions in cement pastes.",

Extensive work has revealed the intuitive impact of the heteroatom effect on the adsorption performance of covalent organic framework (COF) adsorbents for non-polar gases. However, more influencing factors must be studied to more precisely design and construct target-specific COF adsorbents. In this work, an underlying influencing factor, local polarity, is discovered, which is defined as the polarity of the functional moiety. Due to the substitution of strong electrophile, the electron cloud distribution of the COF framework is regulated, and the local polarity that better matches the adsorption of target electrophilic gas (iodine) has been observed.",

Hydroxyl radicals ( · OH) are generated during the reaction process, which can mineralise almost all organic pollutants and intermediates due to its strong oxidative capacity (oxidation potential of 2.8 V), and is particularly outstanding in treating difficult-to-degrade organic pollutants [4,5]. As a representative type of EAOP, electroFenton (EF) technology generates H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ through a 2e$^{- }$oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode surface, which is then activated by a catalyst (e.g. Fe 2 + or transition metal oxides) to generate · OH (Eqs.",

The results suggest that this system is both sustainable and practical, and has great potential for application in treatment of organic pollutants in water.\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nThis work presents an innovative EF based on floating electrodes for the degradation of organic pollutants. The floating system can efficiently produce H$_{2}$O$_{2 }$ (1660.39 mg L$^{-1}$) without aeration.

Due to its excellent physical properties and fascinating chemical properties, gold has a wide range of applications in our daily lives [1 -4]. Given the high demand for gold, mining alone cannot generate sufficient supply because the concentration of gold in the ores is significantly low ( < 10 g/t) compared to other transition metals [5]. It is noteworthy that the amount of gold content in waste electronic equipment is much greater than that in natural ores, and it is estimated that 300 g of gold can be extracted from 1 ton of used computers, which shows that the gold content of electronic waste is 60 to 100 times that of ores of the same quality [6 -10].",

In precious metal recovery, cheap and robust covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) offer industrial feasibility, although having selective binding sites while enhancing semiconductor performance is challenging.

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are highly efficient and environmentally friendly solid-state devices, which thereby have attracted significant attention [1-5]. To promote the commercialization, it is highly demanded for SOFCs to lower the operation temperature (  800  C), which can broaden the materials selection and reduce the cost. However, at redued temperatures, the cathodes of SOFCs are still the main reason for the efficiency loss of the existing systems and performance degradation [6-8].

And with the rise of portable instruments, once the stability of portable electrodes is guaranteed, glassy carbon electrodes may gradually be replaced by small and easy to carry electrodes such as screen printed electrodes and flexible electrodes. Therefore, the materials prepared in this paper can also be tried to be used by portable instruments to broaden its application field.",
