This negative charge attracts positively charged ions, such as calcium (Ca2+), present in the pore solution of the cementitious matrix. Chloride ions (Cl-), being negatively charged, do not directly gravitate towards the C-S-H framework. However, they can be indirectly influenced by the overall ionic strength and composition of the pore solution, which affects the diffusion and migration of ions within the cementitious construct. The subtle interactions that influence chloride ion movement include electrostatic attraction or repulsion, ionic diffusion gradients, and the physical-chemical properties of the C-S-H gel, such as its porosity and pore size distribution.
