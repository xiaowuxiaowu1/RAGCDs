            "groundtruth_answer": "The energetic threshold is characterized by a #preconcentration potential# of #1.20 V# facilitated during the gathering phase on Nafion/ErNBC/GCE.",
            "predicted_answer": "The energetic threshold is characterized by the interaction between Nafion's sulfonic groups and metal ions, supported by the electrochemical and catalytic properties of ErNBC and GCE. This synergy facilitates efficient metal ion adsorption and reduction, optimizing the gathering phase through tuned electrochemical potential and surface interactions.",
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "The Predicted Answer does not mention the #preconcentration potential# of #1.20 V#, which is a key fact in the Reference Answer. While it discusses interactions and electrochemical properties, it misses this specific energetic threshold detail, affecting completeness."

            "predicted_answer": "FT-IR spectra of NBC (neodymium borocarbide) and ErNBC (erbium borocarbide) feature vibrational resonances of Nd/Er-C, B-C, and C-H bonds. These bonds orchestrate characteristic peaks, aligning with stretching, bending, and torsional vibrations indicative of covalent bonding and structural motifs within these borocarbide materials.",

            "groundtruth_answer": "The #small quantity# of materials produced and difficulty in #industrialization# hinder their large-scale promotion and adoption.",
            "predicted_answer": "Intrinsic limitations include scalability challenges, energy inefficiency, and variability in product quality. Veiled impediments involve high operational costs, limited raw material availability, and complex regulatory and environmental compliance. These factors obstruct widespread industrial adoption and bulk implementation of materials synthesized through electrochemical reduction.",
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "The predicted answer addresses scalability and challenges to widespread adoption, aligning with the reference's emphasis on small quantity and industrialization difficulties. However, it doesn't directly mention the \"small quantity\" issue, meaning a key factor is missing."
