            "groundtruth_answer": "NBC and ErNBC exhibit characteristic absorption bands of #-OH stretching# at 3433 cm⁻¹ and #C=O stretching# at 1655 cm⁻¹, aligning with their vibrational resonances.",
            "predicted_answer": "NBC and ErNBC orchestrate vibrational resonances primarily in the fingerprint region (400-1300 cm⁻¹) of FT-IR spectra. NBC exhibits strong bands due to C≡N and N=C=O stretches, while ErNBC emphasizes Er-O vibrations around 400-600 cm⁻¹. Both feature N-H and C-H bending/stretching modes near 1500-3000 cm⁻¹.",
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "The predicted answer does not mention the key facts of #-OH stretching# at 3433 cm⁻¹ and #C=O stretching# at 1655 cm⁻¹, which are crucial for aligning with specific vibrational resonances. Therefore, the predicted answer lacks these essential details present in the reference."
