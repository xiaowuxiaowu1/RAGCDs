            "groundtruth_answer": "The crystal structures involve #C - C# in Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$ and #N - C  N# in CN-150. Heterojunction stability and charge distribution arise from #Ti - C# or #Ti - N# bond formation.",
            "candidate_a": "In Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, the bonds include C-C and Ti-C, crucial for stability and electron transfer. In CN-150, the N-C=N bonds play a key role in charge distribution. Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$’s high conductivity enhances electron transfer, stabilizing the heterojunctions and improving photocatalytic performance.",

These bonds contribute to the stability and charge distribution in their heterojunctions, facilitating efficient electron transfer and enhancing photocatalytic performance.",

            "result": "A win",
            "explanation": "Candidate A and B both mention C-C and Ti-C in Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, and N-C=N in CN-150, matching key facts. However, B incorrectly includes N-C=C, which contradicts the ground truth. Hence, A is more accurate."
