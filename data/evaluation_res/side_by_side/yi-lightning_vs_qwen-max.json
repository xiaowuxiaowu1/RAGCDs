            "candidate_a": "In Ti₃C₂, the main chemical bonds are C-C single bonds within C layers, while in CN-150, the primary bonds are N-CN and N-CC in triazine/heptazine rings. In their heterojunctions, stronger covalent bonds like Ti-C or Ti-N form between Ti₃C₂ and g-C₃N₄, enhancing stability. Ti₃C₂ facilitates charge transfer, improving charge separation and photocatalytic performance by acting as a conductive bridge between CN-150 and Au. This synergy boosts electron transfer, enhancing stability and efficiency in processes like water splitting.",
            "score_a": 5,
            "candidate_b": "In Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$, C - C and C - Ti bonds are present, while in CN-150, N - C  N and N - C  C bonds dominate. These bonds contribute to the stability and charge distribution in their heterojunctions, facilitating efficient electron transfer and enhancing photocatalytic performance.",
            "score_b": 3,
            "result": "B win",
            "explanation": "Candidate B covers all key bonds mentioned in the ground truth: C-C, N-CN, and Ti-C. Candidate A misses the key C-C bond in Ti₃C₂, affecting its completeness. Both candidates avoid contradictions."
