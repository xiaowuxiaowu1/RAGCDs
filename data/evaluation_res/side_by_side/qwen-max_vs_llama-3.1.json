            "candidate_b": "The chemical bonds present in Ti₃C₂ are C-Ti, C-C, C-O, and C  O, while in CN-150, they are C-C, C-N  C, and N-C  N. These bonds play a crucial role in the stability and charge distribution within their heterojunctions, facilitating efficient charge transfer and separation.",
            "score_b": 1,
            "result": "B win",
            "explanation": "Candidate B includes #C - C# in Ti₃C₂ and #N - C  N# in CN-150, matching the key bonds from the Ground Truth. Candidate A misses #Ti - C# or #Ti - N#, which are crucial for stability and charge distribution."
