            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "The predicted answer lacks specific methodologies outlined in the reference, such as using #HCl/H$_{3}$PO$_{4 }$# or #NaOH# for pH adjustment. While it mentions pH adjustment, it doesn't specify the chemicals involved, leading to the omission of key facts."

            "groundtruth_answer": "The energetic threshold is characterized by a #preconcentration potential# of #1.20 V# facilitated during the gathering phase on Nafion/ErNBC/GCE.",
            "predicted_answer": "The energetic threshold is characterized by the reduction potential of the metallic entities, which must be sufficiently negative to overcome the energy barrier and facilitate their deposition on the Nafion/ErNBC/GCE construct during the gathering phase.",
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "The predicted answer lacks key facts from the reference answer, specifically the precise term \"preconcentration potential\" and the specific value \"1.20 V.\" While the concept of energy threshold is mentioned, these details are critical for completeness."

            "explanation": "The predicted answer does not mention the #-OH stretching# at 3433 cm⁻¹ or #C=O stretching# at 1655 cm⁻¹ as in the reference. It instead provides different spectral details (nitrite and hemoglobin-related peaks). Therefore, it misses the key facts emphasized in the reference."

However, it does not explicitly mention small quantities as a limitation. Overall, it aligns with the trend but misses a key detail."
