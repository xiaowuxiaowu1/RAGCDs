On the one hand, according to the previous nucleation mechanism [61], the nucleation effect of CDs can be ascribed to the fact that the hydration products preferentially attach to CDs surface [30], since the nucleation energy on CDs surface is smaller than that in pore solution of cement. This facilitates the crystallization of hydrates. Therefore, CDs can significantly accelerate the hydration of cement.

Extensive work has revealed the intuitive impact of the heteroatom effect on the adsorption performance of covalent organic framework (COF) adsorbents for non-polar gases. However, more influencing factors must be studied to more precisely design and construct target-specific COF adsorbents. In this work, an underlying influencing factor, local polarity, is discovered, which is defined as the polarity of the functional moiety. Due to the substitution of strong electrophile, the electron cloud distribution of the COF framework is regulated, and the local polarity that better matches the adsorption of target electrophilic gas (iodine) has been observed.",

However, for the precise construction of target-specific COFs, more influencing factors need to be identified.\n\nIn this work, we proposed an ionic liquid solution process (ILSP) strategy to post-modify the neutral covalent organic framework TpPaSO$_{3}$H (COF-H) to improve its iodine capture performance (Fig. 1).",

Introduction\n\nLong afterglow luminescence is a special optical phenomenon. Corresponding products can continue to emit light for some time after excitation has ceased, due to electrons being excited and stored in the trap and subsequently released slowly by thermal energy at room temperature [1 -4]. Long afterglow phosphor has been widely used in emergency lighting and displays, decoration, optical information storage, in vivo bio-imaging night vision monitoring, etc [5 -8]. For long afterglow phosphors, emitting centers and traps are two decisive factors worth considering [9,10].

However, their size influence on the enhancement of chloride binding is still a research gap, enormously hindering the further employment of CDs toward cement system. Herein, their size-induced effect on chloride binding actions of cement is comprehensively unveiled using CDs with various sizes for the first time. Specifically, three kinds of CDs with different sizes are controllably prepared through simply altering the calcinating time of citric acid. And the relationship between sizes of CDs and chloride binding capacity of cement is confirmed through the equilibrium tests.

Membrane-based separation technology is widely regarded as a promising reserve method for carbon capture, featuring a wide adjustment range, flexible operation and modular design. In this work, a large-scale interfacial polymerization membrane production process for carbon capture was developed together with the construction of novel interfacial polymerization equipment with an adjustable organic phase bath and surface cross-linking unit. A monomer suitable for efficiently preparing high-performance CO$_{2 }$ separation membranes was selected through a combination of experiments and simulations. The effect of production conditions on the structure and performance of large-scale membranes was investigated. The performance resilience at high pressure and short-term stability in the presence of impurities of the optimized membranes were examined.",

The coordination of Mn 2 + and the porphyrin cavity of PCN-224 significantly enhanced the oxidase-like activity, which catalyzed the formation of blue -green oxTMB from colorless TMB.

Introduction\n\nWith the advancement of the world economy, traditional fossil fuels are consumed at an unprecedented speed and scale, leaving a negative impact on the environment. The lack of fossil energy and the associated environment problems have stimulated the development and utilization of clean energy. As an importantly renewable energy carrier, hydrogen (H$_{2}$) has the potential to solve the energy crisis and play a very important role in future due to its advantages of high combustion calorific value (4.5 times coke), clean and pollution-free [1 -4]. Therefore, the production of high purity H$_{2 }$has attracted enormous research interest. Nowadays, electrochemical water splitting (EWS) has been regarded as one of the most efficient methods to produce hydrogen gas with high purity [5].",

It was consistent with the analysis of CV results. It is speculated that conductive ErNBC can restore the electrode activity to a certain extent, which leads to the increase of peak current and the decrease of interface resistance. These results prove that the NBC are reduced in the CV process. And the conductive ErNBC is conducive to the improvement of Pb 2 + -analysis performance.",

However, there are also some shortcomings that need to be further studied. For example, it is found that the amount of materials prepared by electrochemical reduction method is relatively small, and it is difficult to industrialization and large-scale promotion. And with the rise of portable instruments, once the stability of portable electrodes is guaranteed, glassy carbon electrodes may gradually be replaced by small and easy to carry electrodes such as screen printed electrodes and flexible electrodes. Therefore, the materials prepared in this paper can also be tried to be used by portable instruments to broaden its application field.",
