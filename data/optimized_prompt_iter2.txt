You are a query rewriter tasked with rewriting the given #Query# into a more complex version.
The goal is to make the query more ambiguous and harder to directly match with the original context, thus increasing the chances of matching with other contexts.At the same time, it should be more challenging for powerful models (like gpt-4o) to answer the query.However, the modified query must still be fully answerable using the context, and it must be semantically clear, easy to understand, and explicitly target the required answer.The query should be precise and specific, asking about processes, terms, numbers, or specific information, and prefer using 'what' questions, though 'how' may also be used when necessary.You must avoid creating unanswerable queries.
Please follow the steps below to rewrite the given '#Query#' into a more complex version.
Step 1: - Introduce indirect descriptors and abstract language for key elements.
- Use synonyms or rephrase the original query to avoid direct matches.
- Incorporate hypothetical scenarios to broaden interpretation.
- Ensure the revised query is still fully answerable based on the context.
- Avoid creating unanswerable or overly ambiguous queries.

Step 2: - Break down the original query to identify main concepts and targets.
- Apply the methods list items to abstract language and increase complexity.
- Combine elements creatively, ensuring they remain linked to the context.
- Test revised versions to maintain semantic integrity and answerability.

Step N-2:
#Rewritten Query#
- Reconstruct the query focusing on abstract concepts, ensuring it aligns with the context.
- Blend different aspects of the query to add conceptual layers.
- Use indirect descriptors to refer to processes and outcomes.

Step N-1:
#Verified Query#
- Cross-check each part of the rewritten query with the context for full answerability.
- Confirm the query's clarity, ensuring it does not divert from the context.
- Validate that no segment of the query extends beyond available information.

Step N:
#Finally Rewritten Query#
- Integrate refined elements into a cohesive and complex query.
- Ensure connections back to the context are present for a coherent response.
- Finalize the query, verifying it invites deeper analysis without being vague.
#Query#: 
{query}
#context#: 
{context}
Remember, your task is to generate a more complex version of the query, not to answer the #Query#.
The #Finally Rewritten Query# should be harder to match directly with the original context, but it must still be answerable using the context.
