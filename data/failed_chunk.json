With the increasing Tb 3 + doping, the thermoluminescence intensity reaches the highest when the doping level is 3 at%. When the doping concentration exceeds 20 at%, the thermoluminescence intensity almost disappears. The long afterglow luminescence would be significantly influenced by the trap depth and trap concentration.",

Herein, the Fe-N-doped biochar flakes (FSBC) derived from sesame powder were developed with the help of molten salt strategy for activating PMS to achieve efficient degradation of tetracycline in salt environment. The effect of calcination temperature on physical and chemical properties was studied to further optimize the performance of the catalyst.",

Firouzi and Nguyen [34] reported that the type and concentration of salt will affect the stability of the film and the effect of inhibiting the film rupture. In addition, they reported that both cations and anions affect bubble coalescence.\n\nJeldres et al.",

However, when the reaction product of ACP and AA2P coexisted with TMB, the absorption peak intensity at 652 nm decreased obviously, confirming the competitive effect between the enzymatic reaction product (AA) and TMB.",

The influence of ACP concentration on catalytic oxidation was further explored. As shown in Fig. 3B, the absorbance at 652 nm gradually decreased with the increase of ACP concentration, which was due to the fact that more AA was generated and inhibited the catalytic oxidation reaction of PCN-224-Mn with TMB. Therefore, it was potential to construct a colorimetric probe for OPs ' analysis utilizing OPs to mediate ACP activity to regulate catalytic oxidation reaction.",

As shown in Fig. 3D, the absorbance of the probe solution gradually decreased with the increase of ACP concentration. When the ACP concentration reached 0.08 mg/mL, the absorbance reached the lowest and no longer decreased, indicating that all AA2P was hydrolyzed by ACP. To prevent ACP overdose, 0.06 mg/mL ACP was used for the subsequent experiments. The effect of AA2P concentration on the absorbance is illustrated in Fig. 3E.",

The absorbance remained basically unchanged as the concentration continued to increase, indicating that the enzymatic reaction reached the maximum extent. Therefore, in the following experiments, the concentration of AA2P was set at 2 mM.\n\nIn addition, the influence of incubation temperature on the absorbance of the probe solution is shown in Fig. 3I. The absorbance increased distinctly at temperatures below 37 · C or above 45 · C, mainly due to low enzymatic activity or inactivation of ACP resulting in increased oxTMB production. Hence, the incubation temperature was set at 37 · C in the subsequent experiments.\n\nFurther, the effect of the enzymatic reaction time was explored. In Fig.",

As shown in Fig. 3G, in the absence of ACP, PCN-224-Mn exhibited a high catalytic effect in the pH 3 ~ 6 range. When ACP was present, the absorbance of the probe solution in this range was significantly reduced, and the change was most obvious at pH = 4. This may be related to the high enzymatic activity of ACP under this condition. Fig.",

Most importantly, the removal of man-made compounds depends on their physicochemical properties (i. e . , solubility, hydrophobicity, and dissociative State). For example, carbamazepine, diclofenac, erythromycin, and metoprolol are poorly removed in conventional wastewater treatment processes [3]. However, neglected chiral pharmacologically active compounds (CPACs) often cause unintended ecology hazards [4]. It is common for CPACs to exist as enantiomers, which have similar physical and chemical properties [5], whilst differing in their biological properties (i.e .",

The CPACs enantiomers contribute to varying degrees of biotoxicity to microorganisms and ecosystems as well, with the potential risk of additional bacterial resistance genes [8,9]. Evidence is mounting some enantiomeric pairs have unique ecological effects among themselves. For instance, the 2-aryl propionic acid (2-APA) chiral pharmaceutical enantiomers potentially contribute significantly different toxicity effects to the aquatic models used in eco-toxicity studies [10,11].\n\nDedicated to the separation of chiral compounds, long-standing research has resulted in efficient techniques (i.e .",

The subsequent exfoliation based on stage-2 Li-GICs surprisingly results in the preferential production of bilayer graphene with a high selectivity rate of 78%. Furthermore, this nondestructive exfoliation strategy yields high-quality graphene almost without structural deterioration. The exfoliated graphene exhibits an ultralow defect density ( I$_{D}$ / I$_{G}$ ≈ 0.14) and an ultrahigh carbon-tooxygen ratio ( ∼ 29.7), which is comparable to and even better than that of other state-of-the-art methods ( Table S2 ).",

Currently, Ir- and Ru-based catalysts are still the most efficient catalysts for UOR [31,32], but their high costs have seriously affected their commercial and industrial applications, leading to a gradual shift in research direction towards cheap and abundant transition-metal-based catalysts, such as Co [33,34], Ni [35,36], Fe [37], Cr [38], Zn [39] and Mo [40]-based catalysts.

However, few studies have investigated the problem of insufficient oxygen adsorption capacity of Mn-based single-atom catalysts. Recently developed dual single-atom catalysts can greatly improve the adsorption capacity for oxygen due to their two neighboring active sites, which might solve the problem of difficulty in the adsorption of oxygen by Mn-based single-atom catalysts [21]. Introducing Mn clusters can reconfigure the electronic structure at the active sites of Mn, which can further regulate the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing intermediates at the active sites and, thus, achieve enhanced ORR performance.\n\n## 2.

In industrial hydrogen production, water splitting for hydrogen production is considered to be a promising as well as clean and environmentally friendly way to comply with green chemistry, but it is still not implemented on a large scale [7 -12]. On this basis, the seawater splitting to produce hydrogen is more unlimited by raw materials than the fresh water splitting to produce hydrogen, of course, the difficulty of seawater splitting is also higher.",

Extensive progress has been made in utilizing these materials for water splitting, but performance improvements have been achieved primarily at the laboratory scale. Until now, the electrolysis of seawater is still an undeveloped field. In the early 1970s, scientists proposed the idea of producing hydrogen by direct splitting seawater. For nearly half a century, research teams at home and abroad have been conducting relevant research. However, the principle and technology of large-scale efficient and stable direct splitting seawater hydrogen production are still not smooth. It is hoped that this study can provide an effective idea for preparing effective direct splitting seawater to produce clean energy.",

Specifically, C 1 s and N 1 s XPS spectra of Mo-PTI alongside with annealing treatment (Fig. S7) reveal that besides of ligand derivative carbon, the Mo-C and Mo-N bonds locating at 283.7 and 396.7 eV respectively can be detected in the products [17,31].",

This work indicated that MKPP is a promising adsorbent for the removal of Pb 2 + from aqueous solutions and has the potential for alleviating lead level in blood or TCM extracts. This work also provides a new approach to recycle the agricultural waste, which can alleviate environmental pollution problem. The important findings are as follows:\n\n(1) The adsorption can reach equilibrium in about 10 min, which is relatively faster than other MnO$_{2}$-based or fruit peel-based adsorbents.

In\n\naddition, the OER at the anode consumes 90 % of the electrical energy input, and the oxygen produced inevitably mixes with hydrogen, leading to increased energy consumption and risk of water splitting [13 -15].",

With increasing alkalinity, lactic acid production and hydrogen release are enhanced. When the concentration of KOH solution exceeded 5 mol L - $^{1}$, no obvious change in hydrogen release was observed; meanwhile, the lactic acid production started to decline.

Introduction\n\nCement-based materials serve as the most extensive used construction materials in the world, and their demand increases dramatically as urbanization accelerates [1,2]. However, cement industry is regarded as an intensive source of CO$_{2 }$ emission, and the cement production is responsible for 6.5% of global CO$_{2 }$emission [3]. To overcome the issue, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using green cement production technology [4]; 2) developing the low-carbon cement [5]; 3) prolonging the lifespan of reinforced concrete (RC) structures [6].",

Unfortunately, RC structures are inevitably susceptible to deterioration especially in coastal area and regions subjected to deicing salt application, greatly shortening their service life. It is well-known that the invasion of chloride ions is the principal factor contributing to the deterioration of reinforcement [7,8].\n\nChloride binding technique is considered as one of the most costefficient methods to alleviate the corrosion issue caused by chloride ions [9]. By transforming the freely chloride into immobilized counterparts, chloride binding technique effectively decreases the concentration of free chloride ions, thereby enhancing the durability of RC structures [10].",

Up to now, nanomaterials, supplementary cementitious materials and mineral admixtures have been used to boost anti-chloride-corrosion ability of cement composites [7,13,14].\n\nDespite considerable progress, CDs application of chloride binding technique in cement paste is still in an early stage. There are multitudes of crucial barriers yet to be surmounted. Among them, the size-induced effect of CDs on chloride binding performance in cement is a primary challenge. This can be attributed to two reasons. (1) The sizes of CDs are easily affected by the preparation method, raw materials, and other factors, resulting in a wide range of size variations [31 -33].",

The relationship between sizes of CDs and content of chloride binding for CDs-modified cement pastes is determined by the equilibrium tests.

Introduction\n\nLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have emerged as an innovative solution for renewable energy storage, effectively mitigating persistent energy crises and environmental pollution [1,2]. Their extensive integration across diverse sectors has propelled the global market demand for LIBs [3,4]. The surging demand for lithium (Li), a critical component in LIBs, has amplified [5,6]. Nevertheless, the uneven distribution of natural lithium resources on Earth, coupled with underdeveloped extraction technologies, has significantly strained the supply chain. Projections indicate that discarded LIBs will exceed 11 million tons by 2030, considering their limited lifespan (typically 5-10 years) [7,8]. Inadequate management of retired batteries not only leads to substantial resource wastage but also bears notable environmental consequences.",

Pyrometallurgy necessitates high-temperature smelting, demanding specific equipment, and leading to the depletion of lithium resources and energy, along with the emission of exhaust gases [13,14]. Likewise, hydrometallurgy utilizes strong acid/alkali as leaching reagents, requiring multiple intricate stages and complex procedures to obtain high-purity products, accompanied by the generating tremendous wastewater [15,16].",

The smaller figure of merit implies that the surface electrons are more likely to break free and transfer from the surface to the water molecules.

Introduction\n\nThe treatment, utilization and management of agricultural waste biomass is a challenging problem for national development[1], and a large amount of agricultural waste biomass, due to the lack of feasible and effective methods to recycle, causes environmental pollution and air quality deterioration and other problems. In recent years, people have transformed agricultural waste biomass into value-added products that can be used in various life scenes to achieve environmentally friendly green sustainable development economy[1,2]. Extracting natural polymers from agricultural waste biomass[3] or converting them directly into carbon-based materials[4] can be used in the production of functional composite materials, such as new adsorbents, catalyst carriers and energy storage electrode materials[2,5].\n\nTea residue is a kind of agricultural waste biomass, which is produced in the process of tea planting, processing, storage and consumption[6].",

Herein, tea residue was used as raw material to produce nano-biochar (NBC) by thermal decomposition method. Then the NBC was reshaped in situ on electrode surface to obtain electroreduced NBC (ErNBC) by cyclic voltammetry. After related material characterization, it is found that the properties of NBC are ideally reshaped after in situ electrochemical reduction, the size of NBC is reduced, the content of O element is increased, the hydrophilicity of NBC is enhanced, and the conductivity of NBC is improved.",

Therefore, we developed an electrochemical sensor based on ErNBC combined with machine learning that can selectively detect Pb 2 + in actual water samples.

Although the portable electrochemical detection method is easier to operate than the Nafion/ErNBC/GCE sensor, the detection accuracy of the sensor is higher than that of the portable electrochemical detection method (92.4 %-102.6 %). Therefore, the sensor can be appliedto the detection of actual water samples.\n\n## 6. Conclusions\n\nIn summary, using tea residue as raw material, NBC was prepared by thermal decomposition method, and ErNBC was rapidly obtained on GCE by in-situ electrochemical reshaping of NBC in phosphate buffer. This method utilizes the CV method to prepare ErNBC from tea residue, making it possible to construct Pb 2 + electrochemical sensor with good sensing performance.",
