Phage-based drug development encompasses a diverse range of innovative applications beyond traditional phage therapy for bacterial infections [9,10]. Beyond their role in direct bacterial lysis, phages are being harnessed for various innovative applications, including vaccine development, cancer therapy, and as vectors for gene-delivery systems. Phage display technology, which involves expressing peptides or proteins on the surface of phage particles, has revolutionized vaccine development. This technology allows for the presentation of antigens in a highly immunogenic context, potentially leading to more effective vaccines [11,12].

Biofilms, which are structured communities of bacteria encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix, are implicated in chronic infections and are resistant to antibiotics and immune responses. Phages can penetrate biofilms, replicate within bacterial cells, and disrupt the biofilm matrix, making them potent agents against biofilm-associated infections [7]. In addition to treating extracellular bacteria, phage therapy is being explored for its potential to target intracellular pathogens. Intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella spp., reside within host cells, evading many antibiotics that cannot effectively penetrate cellular membranes. Advances in phage engineering and delivery mechanisms are opening new possibilities for using phages to combat these hidden infections [8].",

Bacteriophages, or simply phages, are viruses that specifically infect bacteria. They were first discovered by Frederick Twort in 1915 and independently by F é lix d'H é relle in 1917, who observed their potential to eliminate bacterial cultures [1,2]. Despite their early promise, the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s led to a decline in phage research and application in the Western world. However, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has rekindled interest in phage therapy as a viable alternative or complement to traditional antibiotics [3-5]. The global health crisis posed by antibiotic resistance has prompted urgent calls for novel antimicrobial strategies.",

To ligate fragments rationally, it is necessary to know where the fragments bind in a pocket.

Firstly, the antibody is selected depending on the molecular target.

Genetic Diversity and Clonal Evolution as a Biological Barrier\n\nOne of the hallmarks of pancreatic carcinoma is its genetic heterogeneity: while certain cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are rooted in a clearly defined small range of 10-15 characteristic mutations, pancreatic tumors often harbor a large number of (on average 50-65) somatic mutations [72,88-90].\n\nThis broad spectrum of genetic alterations comprises both driver and passenger mutations, which affect a dozen core signaling pathways (KRAS, TP53, DNA repair, apoptosis, CDKN2A, SMAD4/TGF-ß signaling, nFκ B, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt/Notch signaling, and Hedgehog) [80,81,91-93].",

Genetic heterogeneity impacts several facets of PC including its tumor biology, its diagnosis, and subsequent therapy.\n\nFrom a cancer biology perspective, pancreatic carcinoma is characterized by its high adaptive potential: because of its broad genetic diversity, PC exploits a large reservoir of genomic mutations and epigenetic alterations, allowing it to quickly adapt to changing environments such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and acidic pH.",

Liver metastasis can often be treated by surgical resection, as the liver is anatomically divided into distinct easily removable segments and has an extraordinary regenerative capacity.

For this purpose, a curative therapeutic does not only have to pass the plasma membrane of a target cell but also overcome the nuclear envelope to gain access to the cellular genome.

Shifts in DNA methylation and histone mark patterns, the two main epigenetic modifications, orchestrate tumor progression and metastasis. These cancer -specific events have been exploited as useful tools for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment choice to aid clinical decision making.

Emerging evidence has suggested that certain neurochemicals, such as dopamine, catecholamines, and acetylcholine, have direct roles in tumor initiation and progression. For example, β -adrenergic signaling has been implicated in promoting EMT and increasing the metastatic potential in cancer cells via the VEGF/MMP and STAT3/ERK/MAPK pathways. 321 Furthermore, Sloan et al. found that both stressinduced and pharmacological β -adrenergic stimulation promoted macrophage migration into tumor tissue in a mouse model of breast cancer.",

This approach would establish novel binding sites for small, drug-like molecules between the \"undruggable\" RAS and the GAP, which the RAS structure, by itself, is lacking.\n\nOur present approach suggests docking to the suitably configured RAS-GAP system, where the \"suitable configuration\" covers the creation of a theoretical (meaning that it is not measured by crystallography) configuration of RAS and GAP.",

Next, we proceeded to create an artificially altered (theoretical) complex structure where the RAS and GAP proteins are pulled apart from each other to generate a space between the two protein molecules. This artificial distancing of the two proteins was achieved by moving the GAP protein away from RAS. To achieve this, we applied a translation on all of the atoms of the GAP protein using a 5 Å long v vector (Figure 1).",

On the one hand, personalized disease models are well suited for clinical decision­making and in clinical trials to diversify the patient cohorts with respect to ethnicity, sex or age. On the other hand, they are poorly suited for high­throughput screenings. To ensure a widespread preclinical and clinical application of human disease models, meeting the following key milestones is essential: definition of robust criteria for disease model validation, benchmarking against patient­derived in vivo data, regulatory approval and legal basis for the implementation of human disease models in the drug development process, and the establishment of scalable, robust and standardized manufacturing processes (Fig. 3 ).",

A key characteristic of cancer is the rapid production of abnormal cells that grow beyond their normal boundaries, potentially invading adjacent body parts and spreading to other organs. This spreading, known as metastasis, is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths [1]. Despite advances in early detection, surgical techniques, and targeted therapy, challenges in cancer treatment persist, including low efficacy, high toxicity, and drug resistance, severely impacting patients' quality of life. Consequently, the search for efficient, safe, and highly selective anti-cancer compounds has become a crucial aspect of contemporary cancer research [2].\n\nThe sea covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and is a land rich in resources.",

These compounds are pivotal in the discovery and development of anti-cancer drugs. Over the past decades, several marine bisindole alkaloids with anti-cancer properties have been identified, including the topsentins, nortopsentins, hamacanthins, dragmacidins, bisindolyl ethylamines, and fascaplysins families. Their novel molecular structures and broad biological and pharmacological activities have generated significant interest. Moreover, these alkaloids have been further modified to synthesize additional compounds with anti-cancer properties. This paper reviews 167 types of marine bisindole alkaloids and their derivatives (Table 1).",

After long-term passaged culture, CRC started to appear. Meanwhile, this team also found that APC mutation, together with miR-483 overexpression in normal organoids, could also induce CRC growth. Thus, we can speculate that the culture of CRC organoids can reflect the association between oncogenesis and multiple genes and can confirm the close correlation between CIN and colorectal carcinogenesis.",

The interactive pathways mainly include chromosome instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and sawtooth-like pathway (46). Therefore, the development of colorectal carcinoids also provides new ideas to study the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis and development.\n\nThe CIN pathway is the most common colorectal oncogenesis pathway by altering chromosome number and structure, thereby changing the genetic environment of the normal colorectal environment.",

Even after this rigorous process of laboratory and clinical research, patient specific differences in treatment response limits therapeutic benefit significantly [2]. This disconnect between preclinical research and the bedside can be attributed to the models we have used to develop these therapeutics.\n\nSpecifically, there are two separate situations that require more physiologically accurate models. The first is drug screening and validation as part of a developmental process that requires translationally relevant models to reduce false positive drug candidates. Next, determination of personalized differences in the treatment response is also important to predict therapeutics' efficacy.",

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in esophageal carcinoma may result in a complete response (25% of patients), partial response (55%), or no response (20%) [113,114]. The use of pre-treatment imaging in radiomics [115,116] and patient-derived plasma samples is beginning to be used in the search for radiation biomarkers [117] to predict treatment response.

Since PET is ready to provide receptor densities with selective radioligand, it can also easily test the efficacy of new drug candidates by measuring the plasma concentration with the receptor occupancy in a time course (40). This data provides a lot of pharmacological information of a new drug in the development process like the penetration capability across the blood-brain barrier, specific binding with the target, and rational dosage selection in different phases of drug development. The drug-receptor occupancy gives us a piece of information about the treatment-induced relative change in the concentration of available receptors, it can be easily calculated with the relative change in the binding potential before and after the drug treatment using PET baseline and blocking studies (41).",

Mechanisms of Ubiquitination\n\nIn the process of ubiquitination, ubiquitin (Ub) protein is covalently attached to substrate proteins either as a monomer (monoubiquitination) or as a polymer chain (polyubiquitination). Monoubiquitination simply adds a single Ub to one or multiple lysine (K) residues of substrates. Polyubiquitination modifies proteins with the C-terminal glycine residue of the Ub (Ub-G76), which is linked with one K residue of the proximal Ub via an isopeptide bond. All K residues in Ub, including K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63, can serve as a linkage site.",

As illustrated earlier, the scope of response biomarkers ranges broadly, spanning from distantly relevant clinical indicators (e.g., target engagement) to presumed mechanistic impacts (e.g., kinase inhibition) to early clinical endpoints (e.g., ORR). Prior to the maturation of long-term outcome or patient survival data, these biomarkers merit consideration in dose optimization. Commonly, dose optimization trials base efficacy assessments on ORR, which can be assessed earlier and often with a smaller patient cohort, and the attainment of a response directly indicates drug activity.",

Some of the highly used pharmacophoric features are, hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrophobic (HY), ring aromatic (RA), and others such as positive ionisable and negative ionisable structures. One of the key features of using pharmacophorebased techniques is that it is effective both in the presence and absence of receptor structure.

Introduction\n\nCancer is one of the major leading causes of human death, and oncology represents the largest therapeutic area in the pharmaceutical industry in terms of number of projects, clinical trials and research investments. The development of new anticancer agents is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that is associated with an high attrition rate [1,2]. The typical development process of (anticancer) drugs includes a preclinical phase followed by three clinical phases. Currently, the preclinical studies required by regulatory authorities are mainly based on bidimensional (2D) cell cultures and animal models, which remain one of the pivotal experimental approaches of translational cancer research [3].\n\nIn 2D in vitro experiments, cell cultures are exposed to drug candidates, usually at constant concentrations for a fixed period.",

Consequently, numerous processes, such as diffusion-limited distribution of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites as well as drug penetration, are lost in 2D cell cultures.",

As a result, the capabilities of 2D cell cultures of predict anticancer drug efficacy is impaired [6,7] and a large number of agents (also showing low efficacy) proceed to the subsequent in vivo phase, which contributes to an overuse of animals, thereby increasing the overall length and cost of the drug development process [8,9].\n\nIn in vivo experiments, the selected compounds are administered to animal models to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and to assess efficacy and safety.",

Spheroids\n\nIn spheroid studies, the applications of image-based techniques typically aim to monitor the temporal dynamics of the 3D morphology over several days in order to identify possible changes induced by the treatment. To this end, multiple morphological features, such as the volume, shape, perimeter, density and diameter, are tracked before, during and after drug exposure. Symmetrically to the in vivo settings, a reduction of spheroid volume is generally considered as the primary endpoint of treatment efficacy [64]. Therefore, tracking the temporal dynamic of spheroid volume is a crucial task.",

In doing so, an existing need is to understand how this translation to clinical practice will occur with products out of patent or regulatory protection. 32 In a detailed review on drug repurposing, Pushpakom et al. summarized the key barriers and a series of responses to capture the full potential of repurposed drugs. 10 They discussed the possibility that while the potential may exist to protect a known drug for a new repurposed use, it must be non-obvious in an inventive sense and there exists the chance that the repurposed use has been described previously in the scientific literature or is known in clinical practice.",

An additional reason relates to the fact that drugs that interfere with cell proliferation may have low tumour specificity\n\nand high toxicity. 33 The underlying reasons for this need in a chemotherapeutic portfolio increase are complex and outlined immediately below and conveniently grouped in three domain areas.\n\n## 5.1 | Cancer complexity with disease progression\n\nCancer is a complex and variable chronic disorder (summarized in Figure 1) in humans with a large potential preventable component.

As a consequence, there are remarkably few classes of very effective therapeutic drugs needed to achieve that purpose in CVD. In the absence of a comprehensive battery of early biomarkers for the early detection of cancer, a great deal of cancer therapy is needed to be directed to the treatment of the established disease.",

Moreover, drug resistance driven by enhanced adaption is undetectable by most preclinical assays of anti-cancer activity. 39 We have described the relationship between hypermutation and DNA repair with cellular-based drug resistance previously. 40 Not surprisingly, this high-level complexity in cancer, unlike the other major chronic disorder of CVD, drives a need not for fewer but for an expanded portfolio of cancer chemotherapeutics.",

In the Earth's crust, it hardly ever exists in either its elemental state or as a pure ore complex. Jöns Jacob Berzelius made the discovery of selenium in 1817 and remarked that it resembled the already-known element tellurium [1]. Although minute amounts of selenium are required for normal cellular function, elemental selenium and selenium salts are hazardous in even small levels and can lead to selenosis [3]. The antioxidants glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, as well as deiodinase enzymes, contain selenium, which is listed as an element in many multivitamins and other nutritional supplements [4,5].",

Selenium compounds have been shown to have antitumorigenic properties in several animal studies [24].\n\nAs a crucial trace element, selenium also performs a number of exclusive activities and has significant metabolic impacts on human health [25]. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium deficit in the human body can lead to many significant life-threatening disorders, such as cancer, liver disease, organ failure, and cardiovascular disease [26,27]. Several studies have demonstrated that individuals with low or deficient selenium levels require an appropriate selenium supplement, which helps in boosting antioxidant activity and augmenting cellular defense capability [28].",

The set of recurrently lost genes in cancer include both tumour suppressors and passenger genes. Tumour suppressors are especially promising targets because they offer tumour cells a selective advantage, and their alteration may therefore be subject to less heterogeneity within a tumour [20].

Due to the complexity and genetic diversity of the disease, there is an increasing trend in the scientific community toward personalized treatment strategies. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have emerged as a groundbreaking tool in oncology research ( Sachs and Clevers, 2014 ), offering three-dimensional cell cultures that better resemble human cancer compared to traditional two-dimensional methods ( Weeber et al., 2017 ). These mini-organs preserve the histological and genetic characteristics of the original tumors ( van de Wetering et al., 2015 ), making them invaluable for studying tumor biology, progression, and treatment response in a controlled laboratory setting. This helps bridge the gap between preclinical models and clinical outcomes ( Vlachogiannis et al., 2018 ).",

Since then, the PNC has been implicated in carcinogenesis. The prevalence of this compartment is positively correlated with disease progression in various types of cancer, and its expression in primary tumors is linked to worse patient outcomes. Using the PNC as a surrogate marker for anti-cancer drug efficacy has led to the development of a clinical candidate for anti-metastasis therapies. The PNC is a multicomponent nuclear body situated at the periphery of the nucleolus. Thus far, several non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins have been identified as the PNC components.

It is indispensable for critical cellular functions, such as the replication of DNA and the production and processing of both coding and non-coding transcripts. Important physiological programs, including the regulation of the cell cycle, different types of stress response, and the maintenance of the overall cellular homeostasis, are to a large extent orchestrated in this part of the cell.\n\nDespite the absence of membrane-enclosed organelles, the nucleus exhibits a high degree of spatial organization. Many nuclear activities are associated with their different non-membraneenclosed domains [ 6 ].

Although the metastatic pattern of certain tumors depends on the characteristics of the primary cancer, there is increasing evidence of the role of the metastasis-target microenvironment in the pathophysiology of metastatic breast cancer [21]. Migrated malignant mammary cells induce the upregulation of growth factors and other cytokines in the bone microenvironment, leading to the activation of osteoclasts and inhibiting the differentiation of osteoblasts. Subsequently, pathologic bone resorption and the secretion of morphogens are responsible for the progression of the imbalance between bone formation and resorption.",

The ECM\n\nobtained by this method can be mixed with living cells before printing or loaded with cells after printing.\n\nThe bioprinting technique is useful in drug screening since it mimics the morphological and genetic profiles of tumors and the non-uniform deposition of various cell types and matrix components [133, 134].

Other challenges related to the bioprinting method include selecting the appropriate bioink for the tumor tissue, the final model's dimensions, the time required for modeling, and the need to improve the resolution. The selected bioink must have both the mechanical and physiological properties necessary for the printing process and the printed tumor simultaneously.

The replication of the latency period of bone metastasis through animal models has posed a challenge, primarily due to the requirement of primary tumor removal and the existence of numerous potential metastatic sites. Novel bone metastasis models, such as three-dimensional (3D) models, have been suggested as a potential solution to address the limitations associated with two-dimensional (2D) models and animal models.

Commonly used techniques include construction of scaffolds, formation of tumor spheroids, and bioink 3D printing. In microfluidics, which originated from the merging of biology and microelectronics, cells can be cultured in micrometer-sized chambers and perfused with very small amounts of fluid ( Whitesides, 2006 ). The fluid can be injected and expelled from microchannels that are engraved on the device and linked to the macroenvironment ( Unger et al., 2000 ). Therefore, the TME can be controlled and manipulated accurately for the analysis of cell kinetics and diffusion effects of live cells.",

        "text": "These randomised trials would require a large sample size to reflect a potentially small effect, posing a significant financial burden [51] This is further complicated by the low rates of patient participation in clinical trials [71], in which 40% of cancer trials fail due to insufficient patient accrual [118]. This demonstrates how clinical trials are not optimised for the evaluation of combination therapies [52]. Drugs which lack single agent activity may still have a significant effect in\n\ncombination therapy, making them difficult to eliminate from further evaluation after ' unsuccessful ' monotherapy phase II clinical trials [51].\n\nThe issues mentioned above highlight the importance of comprehensive, reliable, and predictive pre-clinical combination studies for successful clinical translation [52] so that only the most effective therapeutic combinations will be trialled in phase II or III studies, negating unnecessary costs [119].",
