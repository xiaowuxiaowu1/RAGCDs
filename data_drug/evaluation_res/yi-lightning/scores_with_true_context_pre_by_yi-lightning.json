            "predicted_answer": "The emergent efficacy phenomenon observed is a response rate of approximately 50% when thalidomide is combined with corticosteroids, and about 70% when combined with corticosteroids and an alkylating agent like melphalan. This combination therapy shows enhanced effectiveness against myeloma cells.",
            "score": 5,
            "explanation": "The predicted answer mentions the key fact of a 70% response rate when thalidomide is combined with corticosteroids and an alkylating agent like melphalan, which aligns with the emphasized information in the reference answer. While it includes additional context, the main emergent efficacy is captured accurately."

            "predicted_answer": "The alliance of academic inquiry with corporate pharmaceutical expertise transforms medicinal repurposing by overcoming the scarcity of proprietary stewardship and specialized intellectual resources. This collaboration leverages academic research and industry knowledge, enabling access to failed or off-patent drugs and providing the necessary marketing exclusivity and specialized IP expertise, which are typically lacking outside the pharmaceutical industry. This partnership helps address profit-driven limitations and advances drug repurposing efforts.",
            "score": 5,
            "explanation": "The Predicted Answer captures the key ideas from the Reference Answer, such as transforming medicinal repositioning and providing specialized intellectual resources for marketing exclusivity. However, it includes additional details about access to off-patent drugs and industry limitations, which aligns with the overall trend but adds unnecessary complexity."

            "groundtruth_answer": "The #reduced efficacy# of IP protection for recycled therapeutics arises from weaker #use patents#, costly enforcement, and inability to deter off-label use and non-regulated applications.",
            "predicted_answer": "The metaphoric shield of intellectual property is less effective in recycled therapeutics because repurposed drugs, having known structures, cannot claim novel composition-of-matter patents. Use patents, which protect the method of use, are weaker, more costly to enforce, and do not prevent off-label prescriptions, increasing legal enforcement burdens and failing to deter non-regulated applications.",
            "score": 5,
            "explanation": "The predicted answer aligns with the reference by addressing the reduced efficacy of IP in recycled therapeutics due to weaker use patents, costly enforcement, and inability to deter non-regulated uses. All key facts emphasized in # are covered, and there are no significant omissions."
