            "explanation": "The predicted answer closely aligns with the reference answer, highlighting how the academia-pharmaceutical alliance supports medicinal repositioning by providing specialized intellectual resources. However, it omits the mention of \"marketing exclusivity,\" a key aspect. Therefore, it partially covers the emphasized elements."

            "predicted_answer": "The reduced efficacy of intellectual property in recycled therapeutics stems from weaker \"use\" patents compared to \"composition-of-matter\" patents. These are costly to enforce and do not prevent off-label use, allowing unregulated applications and prescriptions of cheaper generics, undermining their protective value.",
            "score": 5,
            "explanation": "The predicted answer covers all key facts: the reduced efficacy of IP, weaker use patents, costly enforcement, and the inability to prevent off-label use and unregulated applications. The predicted answer explains these points, aligning well with the reference answer without significant omissions."
