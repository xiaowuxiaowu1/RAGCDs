## 1 Introduction

Cancer remains a significant health challenge in the 21st century, with its worldwide impact continuing to grow. Due to the complexity and genetic diversity of the disease, there is an increasing trend in the scientific community toward personalized treatment strategies. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have emerged as a groundbreaking tool in oncology research ( Sachs and Clevers, 2014 ), offering three-dimensional cell cultures that better resemble human cancer compared to traditional two-dimensional methods ( Weeber et al., 2017 ). These mini-organs preserve the histological and genetic characteristics of the original tumors ( van de Wetering et al., 2015 ), making them invaluable for studying tumor biology, progression, and treatment response in a controlled laboratory setting. This helps bridge the gap between preclinical models and clinical outcomes ( Vlachogiannis et al., 2018 ).

Historically, drug development has faced challenges such as high costs and low success rates, with many compounds failing in clinical trials due to inefficacy or unexpected toxicity ( DiMasi et al., 2016 ). PDOs represent a paradigm shift by providing a more predictive model for evaluating the drug efficacy and toxicity. This patientcentered approach also enables the exploration of interpatient variability, which is crucial for personalized medicine ( Wensink et al., 2021 ). The application of PDOs in drug discovery is multifaceted, involving high-throughput screenings to assess compound libraries against a diverse range of organoids ( Drost and Clevers, 2018 ).

This strategy is complemented by co-clinical trials, where organoids derived from a patient ' s tumor are used alongside clinical treatment to administer the most effective therapy ( Servant et al., 2021 ). Additionally, it includes the potential for co-clinical trials and where organoids d f riv f d from a pati f nt ' s tumor ar f used in parallel with the patient ' s clinical treatment to identify the most ffff ctiv f th f rapy for that individual ( Fujii et al., 2016 ). These approaches not only expedite the drug discovery process but also improve the ethical aspects of cancer research by minimizing animal testing and focusing on human models ( Tuveson and Clevers, 2019 ). Moreover, PDOs contribute significantly to understanding drug resistance mechanisms, as researchers can observe resistance patterns and explore combination therapies ( Shaffer et al., 2017 ). They also facilitate the study of the tumor microenvironment, which greatly influences drug sensitivity and resistance ( Katt et al., 2016 ). The advantages and disadvantages of PDOs in cancer research are shown in Figure 1 . Despite these

advantages, the widespread implementation of PDOs in drug development faces practical challenges such as standardizing organoid culture to ensure reproducibility and scalability ( Boj et al., 2015 ). Ethical considerations related to the use of patientderived materials, such as consent and privacy, also require attention ( Munsie et al., 2017 ).

To use the full potential of PDOs in cancer therapy, a multidisciplinary approach is essential, necessitating collaboration across various fields, including oncology, biology, pharmacology, and ethics. This article provides an overview of the current state of PDOs in drug development, acknowledging both the obstacles and the promising directions that could revolutionize cancer treatment.

## 2 Historical perspective

Cancer is an unyielding and intricate adversary. It has been extensively examined using various research models, including traditional in vitro cell lines ( Sajjad et al., 2021 ) and in vivo animal models ( Abdolahi et al., 2022 ) These models have played a crucial role in our initial comprehension of cancer biology and therapeutics. While cell lines offer valuable insights into cancer cell behavior, they often fail to replicate the three-dimensional structure and tumor microenvironment observed in vivo ( Barbosa et al., 2021 ). Animal models, particularly murine ones, provide a systemic perspective but encounter challenges in translatingfindings to clinical settings due to interspecies differences ( Onaciu et al., 2020 ; Shin et al., 2021 ).

The emergence of organoids has revolutionized cancer research by providing three-dimensional cultures derived from stem cells or patient tumors. These cultures closely mimic the architecture and function of organs, offering a relevant platform for studying cancer biology and therapy ( Clevers and Tuveson, 2019 ). The use of cancer cells cultivated in three-dimensional environments has yielded clinically pertinent data, reflecting the tumor environment of patients ( Fessart and Delom, 2024 ). Personalized medicine has especially benefited from the development of PDOs, which accurately replicate the genetic, transcriptomic, and histopathological characteristics of the patient ' s tumor. PDOs serve as effective tools for drug screening and predicting therapeutic responses ( Xu et al., 2019a ). Advancements such as integration of CRISPR -Cas9 technology with organoid cultures have further propelled the field by enabling precise genetic manipulation and facilitating the study of gene function and drug -gene interactions within a relevant tumor context ( Hendriks et al., 2021 ). High-throughput screening technologies have expedited the identification of potential therapeutic agents ( Tuveson and Clevers, 2019 ). Furthermore, the inclusion of immune cells in co-culture systems has provided invaluable insights into the tumor immune microenvironment, which is essential for development of immunotherapies ( Campillo et al., 2019 ). The establishment of biobanks for organoid lines, ensuring a diverse representation of tumor subtypes and patient demographics, has been another significant stride, providing valuable resources for ongoing and future oncological studies ( Tuveson and Clevers, 2019 ).

In conclusion, the integration of organoid technology into oncology research marks a significant shift in drug development. This approach sets the stage for a new era of personalized cancer therapy, with the potential to bridge the gap between preclinical studies and clinical application, thereby enhancing outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.

## 3 Biotechnological advances in organoid culturing

PDOs represent a significant breakthrough in cancer research, utilizing the inherent ability of stem cells to self-organize into threedimensional (3D) structures. These structures emulate the intricate architecture and function of native tissues ( Kretzschmar, 2021 ). The process involves harvesting stem cells from a patient ' s tumor biopsy, which are then cultured in specialized scaffolds that support 3D growth, along with growth factors that simulate the natural cellular environment. The resulting organoids retain the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the original tumor ( Drost and Clevers, 2018 ), marking an important milestone in personalized medicine. Advancements in the field have been propelled by improved culturing methods, such as the use of the Matrigel dome technique and the development of synthetic and tunable hydrogels, including alginateand collagen-based matrices ( Tuveson and Clevers, 2019 ; Fang et al., 2023 ). These innovations offer controlled environments that enhance reproducibility across

different research settings ( Tuveson and Clevers, 2019 ). Additionally, the integration of microfluidic systems with precise microchannels has streamlined the automated delivery of nutrients and waste management, optimized growth conditions, and enabled large-scale, high-throughput drug screening ( El Harane et al., 2023 ). 3D bioprinting technology has further advanced organoid complexity by allowing precise placement of cells and matrix components in a layer-by-layer fashion ( Drost and Clevers, 2018 ; Tuveson and Clevers, 2019 ; Fang et al., 2023 ). This creates intricate and diverse structures that more accurately reflect the tumor microenvironment, including vascular networks, which are crucial for studying the effects of anticancer drugs targeting the tumor vasculature ( Zhao et al., 2021 ).

The co-culture capability of bioprinting permits various cell types, such as cancer, stromal, and immune cells, to be cultured together, generating a more precise model of tumor -immune system interactions -a key aspect in immunotherapy research ( Drost and Clevers, 2018 ; Tiwari et al., 2022 ). These advancements are transforming preclinical drug development by providing models that more closely resemble patient tumors, enhancing the accuracy of predictions regarding drug effectiveness and resistance, which could lead to tailored treatment plans ( Lim et al., 2023 ). For instance, researchers have successfully bioprinted glioblastoma organoids from patients, which incorporate endothelial cells, facilitating personalized evaluations of responses to anti-angiogenic therapies ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). This approach not only has the potential to improve treatment outcomes but also reduce the time and costs associated with traditional drug development processes. Despite these advancements, it is crucial to address the challenges that persist in fully harnessing the potential of these technologies. Broad adoption in research and clinical settings requires consideration of factors such as cost, accessibility, and standardization ( Tu et al., 2023 ). Moreover, further research is needed to refine bioprinting techniques for scalability and to ensure the long-term viability and functionality of complex organoids ( Hafa et al., 2023 ). In summary, recent innovations in organoid culturing technologies, including synthetic hydrogels, microfluidic systems, and 3D bioprinting, are revolutionizing preclinical cancer research. These technologies facilitate the development of more complex and patient-specific models that could significantly advance personalized cancer therapy by overcoming limitations of traditional cultures and providing more accurate representations of tumor biology.

## 4 Organoids in cancer research: current applications

PDOs have played a crucial role in cancer research by bridging the gap between basic in vitro cell lines and complex in vivo animal models. Figure 2 show the limitations of the use of cell lines and animal models in cancer research. These three-dimensional, multicellular systems accurately replicate the structural and functional characteristics of human tumors, making them indispensable for personalized medicine and the study of cancer progression, metastasis, and treatment response ( Sachs et al., 2018 ). PDOs maintain the genetic and phenotypic features of the original tumor, allowing for precise evaluation of individual drug responses

and the development of personalized treatments ( Drost and Clevers, 2018 ). They also provide insights into the dynamics of cancer progression and the role of the microenvironment, including the influence of stromal and immune cells ( Nagini, 2017 ).

For instance, pancreatic cancer PDOs have provided valuable information about tumor invasion and metastasis, revealing that elevated levels of doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) can drive cancer cell migration. Additionally, targeting DCLK1 may inhibit liver metastasis, suggesting potential new therapeutic targets ( Ito et al., 2016 ). Moreover, these organoids are instrumental in drug screening and preclinical testing, expediting the discovery of novel cancer treatments. Organoids derived from mammary Paget ' s disease (MPD) have been particularly beneficial for breast cancer research as they accurately represent the genomic landscape of the disease, including copy number variations, mutational burden, and specific mutations in cancer-related genes identified through extensive genomic sequencing. Consequently, MPD organoids serve as an effective ex vivo platform for studying both the clinical and genomic aspects of breast cancer ( Yu et al., 2022 ). In the context of glioblastoma, patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) and the resulting organoids retain the key characteristics of the original tumor, making them suitable for drug screening and predicting therapeutic responses. Studies have shown that glioblastoma organoids respond to treatments such as temozolomide and targeted therapies, thus paving the way for personalized interventions based on genetic and epigenetic markers ( Xu et al., 2019b ; Yu et al., 2022 ). For example, researchers have used glioblastoma PDOs to identify potential new drugs. These drugs are currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials ( Rahman et al., 2023 ).

Technological advancements in culturing methods and bioengineering are propelling the research field forward. Novel extracellular matrix analogs, microfluidic systems, and 3D bioprinting are improving organoid viability, function, and structure, enabling the creation of more sophisticated models for tumor studies and personalized medicine ( Xu et al., 2019b ; Yu et al., 2022 ). Additionally microfluidic systems enable dynamic culturing with continuous nutrient supply and waste removal and further improving the physiological relevance of these models ( Babaliari et al., 2023 ). Figure 3 illustrates the current and future applications of PDOs.

However, challenges such as scalability, cost, and standardization persist. Efforts are underway to incorporate immune cells and capture the full spectrum of tumor heterogeneity in PDOs ( Xu et al., 2019b ; Ding et al., 2021 ). In conclusion, PDOs are revolutionizing cancer research by providing models that closely resemble human tumors. The integration of cellular biology and cutting-edge bioengineering holds great promise for the future of personalized therapies and targeted treatments. Continuous technological advancements and addressing current limitations are essential for PDOs to potentially transform cancer treatment and significantly improve patient outcomes.

An example of this is the utilization of the therapeutically guided multidrug optimization (TGMO) technique in colorectal cancer models. This approach has proven effective in identifying optimized drug combinations that surpass the efficacy of conventional care ( Cheng et al., 2022 ).

In another study, Neal et al. presented an air -liquid interface (ALI) method that enables the growth of PDOs from tumors in both humans and mice. This method preserves the tumor epithelium and the native immune cells (T, B, NK, and macrophages) that are present within the tumor. Consequently, the PDOs accurately replicate the original tumor ' s T-cell receptor (TCR) spectrum ( Neal et al., 2018 ). Despite these advancements, challenges such as cost, scalability, and standardization remain in the use of PDOs for drug development. Active research areas include incorporating the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and immune system components. Addressing these hurdles will be essential for wider adoption and full realization of PDOs ' transformative potential in cancer treatment ( Genova et al., 2021 ; Lv et al., 2022 ).

## 6 Personalized medicine and patientderived organoids

Personalized medicine in oncology is undergoing a significant transformation with the use of PDOs. These PDOs play a crucial role in developing individualized treatment strategies by cultivating a patient ' s own tumor cells, which accurately represent the specific genetic and molecular properties of their cancer. This precision approach not only enhances treatment efficacy but also reduces side effects and the use of ineffective medications ( Wang et al., 2022a ; Zeng et al., 2023 ). Evidence strongly supports the use of PDOs for pre-treatment testing, as studies have shown higher response rates and improved survival outcomes compared to conventional treatments that do not consider individual variability ( Yahng et al., 2017 ; Wensink et al., 2021 ). PDOs serve as reliable in vitro models that simulate the patient ' s tumor environment, providing a

predictive framework for understanding how a tumor may respond to specific therapies ( Dantes et al., 2023 ). Integrating genomic data with organoid responses holds promise in creating predictive models, especially for rare or aggressive cancer types with limited treatment options. For example, a 2021 study used PDOs to forecast responses to immunotherapy in melanoma patients, helping identify those most likely to benefit from such treatments ( Abbott et al., 2021 ).

While PDO technology has vast potential, it is crucial to address the ethical implications inherent in patient-centered medicine. Issues such as ownership of biological material, commercial use of organoids, informed consent, and genetic privacy must be carefully navigated. Clearly defined consent processes and ethical guidelines are essential to maintaining patient trust and effectively managing unexpected genetic findings that could impact patients or their relatives ( de Jongh et al., 2022 ). It is crucial to maintain trust and int f grity within the patient -physician relationship and the broader medical community. Although PDOs have immense potential, challenges still exist in fully realizing their clinical utility for personalized medicine. Cost and scalability and potential discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo responses are key limitations that require attention ( Goetz and Schork, 2018 ). Furthermore, despite the potential of PDOs, there are practical hurdles that hinder their widespread clinical application. Challenges such as cost, scalability, and disparities between in vitro and in vivo responses are significant and are actively being addressed by the scientific community. Ongoing research aims to improve the scalability and standardization of PDOs, and the integration of complementary technologies like microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI) is paving the way for broader implementation and more sophisticated applications.

In conclusion, PDOs offer a transformative avenue for cancer treatment and drug development. Their unique ability to replicate individual tumor biology and predict treatment response brings us closer to a future of more precise and effective cancer therapies. Addressing ethical considerations and overcoming current obstacles are key to unlocking the full potential of this innovative technology.

## 7 Challenges and limitations

PDOs hold tremendous potential in the fields of personalized medicine and drug development. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed through further research. One significant challenge is maintaining the inherent heterogeneity and complexity of tumors within PDOs. A single PDO model may not fully capture the complexity of an entire tumor because intra-tumor heterogeneity can lead to varying growth patterns and drug responses, making clinical applications more complicated ( Ramon et al., 2020 ; Bose et al., 2021 ). Another crucial aspect is long-term viability and functionality, which require a deep understanding of the tumor microenvironment, including stromal interactions and nutrient signaling ( Gjorevski et al., 2016 ; Chitrangi et al., 2023 ).

Standardization is also a persistent concern, as variations in protocols, starting materials, and culture media compositions can impact the reproducibility of organoid formation and function ( Manduca et al., 2023 ). Therefore, it is essential to establish uniform methods to ensure consistent and reliable data generation. Additionally,

scaling up PDO production poses challenges, especially for aggressive cancers where prompt therapeutic decisions are vital. High-throughput drug screening integration requires cost-effective automation technologies that can maintain patient-specific characteristics ( Gjorevski et al., 2016 ).

Research advancements are aimed at mitigating these limitations. Bioprinting and improved culture media formulations are being developed to enhance PDO viability and accurately replicate the tumor microenvironment ( Geyer and Queiroz, 2021 ). Microfluidic platforms for high-throughput drug screening show promise for efficient analysis of PDOs ( Xu et al., 2019b ).Theroleofthetumor microenvironment is pivotal, particularly in influencing the immune response in cancer research. Current PDO models lack continuous blood flow and the diverse cellular components found in vivo .Thiscan be addressed by incorporating immune cells, endothelial cells, and stromal components into the organoid culture to better simulate physiological conditions ( Choo et al., 2021 ).

The ongoing research is improving the fidelity of PDOs used in cancer research by addressing their limitations in simulating the TME. Bioprinting technologies show promise in reconstructing the TME with greater accuracy, leading to more representative organoid models ( Mi et al., 2023 ). Researchers are developing advanced culture media that better support PDO viability by mimicking interactions with stromal cells and key signaling molecules ( Manduca et al., 2023 ). Additionally, microfluidic platforms are being explored for their potential in high-throughput drug screening, enabling efficient and cost-effective analysis of PDOs ( Geyer and Queiroz, 2021 ; Yoon et al., 2024 ).

The effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies is closely linked to the TME ' s role in modulating the immune response. However, current PDO models lack continuous blood flow, which is essential for immune cell recruitment ( Wang et al., 2022b ; Peng et al., 2022 ). This limitation can be addressed by co-culturing PDOs with immune cells to reflect dynamic tumor -immune interactions ( Peng et al., 2022 ). Nevertheless, traditional PDOs often exclude non-tumorcellularcomponentsofthe TME, which play a crucial role in shaping immune responses through mechanisms like hypoxia and the presence of immunosuppressive cells ( Wang et al., 2021 ). To capture the complexity of the TME, research has focused on integrating immune and endothelial cells into organoid cultures ( Wang et al., 2022b ; Peng et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, investigations are underway for tumor microenvironment-responsive nanomedicines to regulate the TME and enhance immunotherapy outcomes ( Wang et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2022b ). These advancements are crucial in creating physiologically relevant in vitro models that can more accurately mimic the intricate interactions between tumors and the immune system in cancer research. As technology progresses, these improvementsinPDOmodelshavethe potential to revolutionize personalized cancer therapy and drug development, bringing us closer to clinical applications that replicate the true complexity of human cancers.
