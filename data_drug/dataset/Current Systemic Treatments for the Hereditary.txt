Advances in the genetic basis of different tumors have led to identification of tumor vulnerabilities that can be turn into targeted therapies. In this regard, PARP inhibitors cause synthetic lethality with tumors harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic alterations. On the other hand, tumors with microsatellite instability, either due to germline or sporadic alterations, are candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease who carry a germline alteration in the VHL gene may benefit form belzutifan, a hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha inhibitor. Overall, research on the underlying pathological mechanisms of these tumors has provided new therapeutic opportunities that might be expanded to other sporadic tumors with similar biology.

More than a century ago, investigators made clinical observations on the hereditary characteristics of cancer, such as cancers diagnosed in patients at a younger age and in many members of the family. 1 , 2 Moreover, cancer syndromes began to be recognized as the presentation of multiorgan neoplasms in a single patient or family. In particular, the findings of what later became called von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome -retinal hemangioblastomas and cerebellar and spinal hemangioblastomas -were reported by Drs. Collins, Hippel, and Lindau at the beginning of the previous century. 3 -5 Around that time, Dr. Warthin described the first German immigrant family (named Family G) in Michigan with cancers involving the gastrointestinal tract and uterus, 6 , 7 later in 1960s further characterized by Dr. Lynch. 8 -11 It has been fascinating to see how clinical observations and scientific discoveries have evolved and aided our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of hereditary cancer syndromes over many decades. 12 -14 In that line, with the discovery of DNA, in 1950s, the investigators were able to link the concept of heredity to this intracellular genetic material. 15 -17 Later in the 1990s, the development of cloning technologies fostered gene discovery and their relationship with hereditary syndromes. 12 -14 The gene located at chromosome 3p25-26, VHL gene, was found to be associated with VHL syndrome tumors and sporadic renal cell carcinoma. 18 -21 Similarly, BRCA1 gene at chromosome 17q and BRCA2 gene at chromosome 13q were described as the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. 22 -26 Around the same time, many other laboratories investigating mechanisms of colorectal

cancers discovered the ubiquitous mutations in repetitive DNA sequences, microsatellites, and their association with sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancer. 27 -32 To close the loop on the systematic investigations on the family " G " with Lynch syndrome, more recently the 929 descendants of Family G were sequenced and confirmed the germline mutation in MSH2 gene causing microsatellite instability and susceptibility to colorectal cancers. 33

Based on multigenerational collaboration and commitment leading to foundational discoveries, in recent years, understanding the germline defects and related biologic consequences helped to us develop effective drugs for these syndromes. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have shown to be effective in patients with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer with a germline or sporadic BRCA mutation. 34 -37 Similarly, hypoxia-inducible factor 2 a (HIF2 a ) inhibitors were shown to be effective in VHL syndrome. 38 , 39 Moreover, advancements in the tumor immunology field and the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors led to the development of effective treatment of Lynch syndrome. 40 In this review, we will summarize the mechanism of these drugs and selected clinical trials that led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals in these neoplastic syndromes ( Fig. 1 ).

## PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

- GLYPH<C15> Understanding the biological underpinnings of hereditary neoplastic syndromes is critical to developing therapies not only for the syndromes but also for sporadic cancers with similar pathological mechanisms.
- GLYPH<C15> PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib) are recommended for the treatment of germline or sporadic BRCA mutated, or homologous recombination deficient breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreas cancer at different specific indications.
- GLYPH<C15> Immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, is recommended for the treatment of patients with germline or sporadic high microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficient solid tumors. Similarly, nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab is recommended for the treatment of high microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers.
- GLYPH<C15> Hypoxia inducible factor 2 a inhibitor, belzutifan, is recommended for the treatment of patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease who require therapy for renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system hemangioblastoma, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery.

wild type allele, and therefore have a defective homologous recombination repair pathway for DNA doublestrand breaks. PARP is a family of enzymes involved in the repair of single-strand breaks, as well as the repair of collapsed replication forks. PARP inhibitors block the catalytic activity of PARP and lead to trapping of the PARP enzyme in the DNA strand, which consequently leads to an increase of double-strand breaks during cell replication. As a consequence, those tumors lacking a proficient homologous recombination repair pathway (i.e., BRCA-associated) will accumulate DNA damage that will lead to cell death. Following the preclinical proof-of-concept of this synthetic lethality approach, several PARPi have been approved to treat BRCA-associated breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer. 41 Here, we will review and update the current knowledge about the role of PARPi in patients with germline BRCA (g BRCA ) breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. The role of PARPi in ovarian and prostate cancer was reviewed previously in detail. 36 , 37

Clinical development of PARPi in patients with g BRCA metastatic breast cancer Four randomized, open-label phase III trials evaluated the use of PARPi in patients with HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer harboring germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes.

OlympiAD, BRAVO, and EMBRACA trial compared olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib in monotherapy, respectively, with single-agent chemotherapy. 42 -44 BROCADE 3 trial randomly assigned patients to receive veliparib or placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. 45 All trials allowed until two 43 -45 or three prior cytotoxic regimen lines. 42 Crossover was not allowed in any trial, except one. 45 Platinum-based treatment was allowed if there was no progression during treatment or within 6 -12 months after last dose in the neo/adjuvant setting.

In all, the primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Olaparib, talazoparib, and veliparib achieved its primary objective with a significant increase of PFS. The risk of disease progression or death was 42% lower with olaparib than with standard therapy. Talazoparib showed a significantly longer median PFS compared with the standard-therapy group (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 -0.71). Addition of veliparib to carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy resulted in significant and durable improvement in PFS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57 -0.88). Niraparib in the BRAVO trial failed in its primary endpoint with no significant differences in PFS between the two study groups (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65 -1.44). A worse baseline prognosis of patients in BRAVO might explain the lower PFS compared with OlympiAD and EMBRACA. In terms of overall survival, a significant improvement was only observed in OlympiAD among patients who did not receive previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 -0.90). 46 Although the mechanisms of action are similar, variation in the outcome measures between trials can be explained by heterogeneity of study population, assessment, and enrollment criteria per genetic alterations.

The safety profile was similar across the three trials with PARPi in monotherapy, and showed that hematologic toxicity had the most common grade 3 -4 events ( Table 1 ). Therefore, close monitoring and management of these toxicities is necessary during the treatment ( Table 2 ). Importantly, a significant delay in the onset of clinically meaningful deterioration according to the global health status quality-of-life scale QLQ-C30 was demonstrated in the OlympiAD and EMBRACA trials.

A relevant issue is the lack of platinum in the control arms of the above trials, whose expected overall response rate in this population is 68% and very similar to PARPi in monotherapy. 47 This leads to the question of the

appropriateness of sequencing these treatments. Interestingly, the ABRAZO phase II trial aimed to answer this question and observed that talazoparib ' s efficacy after platinum was correlated with longer platinum-free interval. 48 Similarly, in the BROCADE 3 trial, a subset of patients assigned to the control group received veliparib monotherapy as first subsequent therapy after disease progression. Among them, a platinum-free interval longer than 180 days was correlated with greater veliparib activity. 49

Regarding combination with immunotherapy, the TOPACIO phase II trial explored the safety and efficacy of niraparib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) including a cohort of patients with tumor BRCA1/2 mutation. 50 Among 15 patients with a tumor BRCA1/2 mutation, the objective response rate (ORR) was 47% and the median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 2.1 -not estimable). Therefore, with a similar ORR to monotherapy with olaparib or talazoparib in patients with TNBC and mutated BRCA1/2, but a 3-month longer median PFS. The MEDIOLA phase I/ II basket trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and 12week disease control rate with the combination of durvalumab and olaparib in solid tumors. 51 Overall, 34 patients with

metastatic HER2 - breast cancer with g BRCA1/2 mutation were included. At 12 weeks, 80% achieved disease control and 63% an ORR. The safety profile of the combination was similar to that previously described for olaparib and durvalumab in monotherapy.

Clinical development of PARPi in the adjuvant setting for patients with g BRCA breast cancer After the improved outcome and quality of life observed in the metastatic setting with both olaparib and talazoparib versus chemotherapy, 42 , 43 testing PARPi at an earlier phase of the disease was expected.

In the phase III randomized OlympiA trial, 52 patients with HER2-negative high-risk breast cancer harboring a pathogenic g BRCA1/2 mutation were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive olaparib versus placebo for 1 year after completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, with invasive diseasefree survival as the primary endpoint. A total of 1,836 patients were included; 82.2% with TNBC, 72.3% presenting a g BRCA1 , and 27.2% a g BRCA2 mutation; 93.7% had received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy with an anthracycline and a taxane, and a platinum agent was used in 26.5% of the patients. At 3 years of follow-up, invasive disease-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib arm:

86% and 77% for olaparib versus placebo, respectively (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41 -0.82; p < .001). Distant disease-free survival was also clinically improved with 88% in the olaparib group and 80% in the placebo group (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39 -0.83; p < .001), leading to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of olaparib in the adjuvant setting. More importantly, the benefit of invasive disease-free survival was observed in all prespecified subgroups irrespective of BRCA mutation, estrogen receptor status, or previous chemotherapy (neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant). No new safety signals were identified, with only 10% of patients having to discontinue olaparib due to toxicity (vs. 4% in the placebo arm). No statistically significant benefit in overall survival was observed at an interim-analysis, and final analysis are awaited.

Integrating these results with the CREATE-X 53 and the last update from Keynote-522 54 studies are challenging. The CREATE-X trial evaluated the benefit of adjuvant capecitabine (vs. no capecitabine) for patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who had residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At 5 years, a significant impact on overall survival was mostly observed in those with TNBC, with 78.8% versus 70.3% in the capecitabine versus control arm, respectively (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 -0.90). In the Keynote-522, pembrolizumab (vs. placebo) in addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by nine cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab was tested in TNBC, yielding an absolute benefit of 13.6% in pathologic complete response and 7.7% in event-free survival (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 -0.82), becoming the new standard of care for unselected early stage TNBC. Importantly, none of the trials have specifically examined the benefit of adjuvant capecitabine or pembrolizumab in the g BRCA population. Furthermore, olaparib has proven to be more effective than capecitabine in the advanced setting in the OlympiAD trial. 43 A research question is whether combining olaparib and pembrolizumab might be a future option for patients with TNBC harboring a g BRCA mutation who do not achieve a pathologic complete response. In view of these results, we conclude that g BRCA testing at an early phase of the disease plays a key role to select the best treatment strategy.

The role of PARPi in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with g BRCA breast cancer One of the multiple lessons learned with the clinical development of PARPi in the metastatic setting was the appearance of resistant mechanisms mostly due to recovery of homologous recombination function. One of the biologic reasons for homologous recombination recovery is the predominance of cancer cell clones that carry BRCA reversion mutations that restore the reading frame and translate a functional protein. These cancer cell clones seem to arise from Darwinian selection under selective therapeutic pressure, which is expected to be less frequent in treatment-naïve patients with BRCA -associated breast cancer. Together with the favorable safety profile of PARPi, an

increased interest in assessing the clinical efficacy of PARPi in the neoadjuvant setting arose. Following this rationale, NeoTALA 55 is a phase II trial assessing the efficacy of neoadjuvant talazoparib in patients with g BRCA1/2 -mutated, HER2-negative early breast cancer. Overall, 61 patients, all with TNBC, were enrolled to receive 1 mg/day of talazoparib during 24 weeks. The pathologic complete response was 49%, comparable with that observed with combination of anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy, and without unexpected safety findings. So far, results are encouraging to continue with clinical development in this setting. Additionally, two clinical trials have reported their results of combining a PARPi with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. BrighTNess assessed the efficacy of adding carboplatin, with or without veliparib, to standard paclitaxel and anthracyclinebased regimen in patients with TNBC, stratified by g BRCA1/ 2 genetic status. 56 In the overall population, the study showed the efficacy of adding carboplatin, but not veliparib, in terms of pathologic complete response and event-free survival. 57 Of note, a recent matched cohort study of g BRCA mutation carriers within this trial showed that the addition of carboplatin, regardless of veliparib, to neoadjuvant paclitaxel and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, was associated with increased pathologic complete response in patients with nong BRCA , but not in g BRCA carriers. 58 Another trial is GeparOLA, which assessed the rate of pathologic complete response of paclitaxel with olaparib compared with paclitaxel with carboplatin, followed by anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer and homologous recombination deficiency, which includes patients with germline or tumor BRCA1/2 mutation. 59 No differences in pathologic complete response were observed between olaparib and carboplatin combinations in patients with tumor or gBRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (60%). However, patients who were hormone receptor -positive and patients younger than age 40 benefited from olaparib compared with carboplatin (53% vs. 20%, and 76% vs. 45%, respectively). These results deserve further investigations.

Ongoing clinical trials and future directions with PARPi in patients with g BRCA breast cancer There are multiple ongoing trials of the commercially available PARPi, as well as a new generation of selective PARP1 inhibitors, like AZD5305, 60 intended to reduce hematologic toxicity driven by PARP2 trapping. In Table 3 , the main ongoing clinical trials with PARPi in patients with g BRCA breast cancer are summarized.

PARP inhibitors have shown to be a targeted therapeutic option for patients with breast cancer and a g BRCA mutation in the metastatic and adjuvant setting with an optimal safety profile. Ongoing research is focused on expanding their use beyond patients with g BRCA alterations, and to define whether combination with immunotherapy or other DNA damage-repair agents are more effective.

## Role of PARPi in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

Defects in the DNA damage-repair pathway are known to occur in the oncogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. While many of these errors are somatic, some reflect underlying germline mutations in DNA damage-repair mechanisms. Up to 9% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma harbor a g BRCA mutation, 61 which causes homologous recombination defects and synthetic lethality with PARPi. 62

The POLO trial sought to establish the first targeted therapy in g BRCA -mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 63 Positioning a PARPi as postchemotherapy maintenance, POLO was a randomized, double-blind, phase III design that assigned patients in a 3:2 ratio to olaparib 300-mg tablets twice daily versus placebo control. Of the 3,315 patients who underwent screening, 154 underwent randomization and were assigned to a trial intervention (92 to receive olaparib vs. 62 on placebo). Regarding the primary endpoint, the median PFS was significantly longer on olaparib versus placebo (7.4 months vs. 3.8 months; HR for disease progression or death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35 -0.82; p = .004). Based on the POLO-demonstrated PFS benefit, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved olaparib ' s use in this g BRCA pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma maintenance treatment setting in December 2019. 64 However, when overall survival data matured (with primary analysis performed after 108 deaths), overall survival was similar for olaparib versus placebo (median 19.0 and 19.2 months, respectively; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.56 -1.22; p = .3487). 65 In addition to the lack of overall survival benefit, concerns have been raised with the design of the study including placebo instead of 5FU monotherapy. 66 Moreover, olaparib associated health care costs with lack of overall survival benefit is further concerning.

Nonetheless, the POLO trial heightened awareness of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as a sentinel feature of germline cancer predisposition syndromes. Correspondence written to the New England Journal of Medicine following the seminal publication objected " the authors do not mention the crucial implications related to the broadening population of patients who are going to be tested for and counseled about germline BRCA mutations, " noting that " the recognition of hereditary syndromes is important in order to set up dedicated follow-up to reduce the incidence of second tumors among survivors and to reduce mortality among their relatives. " 67

POLO-prompted identification of this " tip-of-the-iceberg " phenomenon may ultimately have a more substantial impact on survival than olaparib itself. It is within such cascades that

genomically driven oncology can become a matter of public health concern. Because large-scale germline exome sequencing efforts have surfaced a " highly polygenic genomic architecture, the ' genetic economics ' of frequency penetrance clearly indicates that focused identification of carriers of mutations like BRCA is most impactful for cancer control. " 68

## DEVELOPMENT OF PEMBROLIZUMAB FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIGH MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY COLORECTAL CANCER

Microsatellite instability and mismatch repair deficiency are closely interrelated phenomena that confer potential susceptibility to immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab, a PD-1 blocker. The KEYNOTE-177 69 study was a phase III open-label trial of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy (5-FU-based therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) in which 307 treatment-naive patients with metastatic high microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer were randomly assigned 1:1. At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to the coprimary endpoint of PFS (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 -0.80; p = .0002).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of pembrolizumab for this indication in June 2020 was predicated on the PFS benefit, 70 and the editorial accompanying the landmark New England Journal of Medicine publication heralded a new standard of care for high microsatellite instability colorectal cancer, citing the durability of response (among those with an overall response, 83% of the pembrolizumab group had ongoing responses at 24 months), better safety profile, and improved quality of life as reasons to prefer immunotherapy over chemotherapy. 71

Though it had long been known that somatic mutations had the potential to encode " nonself " immunogenic antigens that increased tumor identification to the host and, in turn, susceptibility to PD-1 blockade, 72 , 73 KEYNOTE177 also immediately changed the standard of care for patients with germline mismatch repair deficiency and its hallmark microsatellite instability who developed advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.

In patients with Lynch syndrome, there had previously been dual concerns about the lessened efficacy of fluoropyrimidines (at least as monotherapy $^{74}$) and thus the need for intensified exposure to partner drugs like platinums, 75 which then incurred the very real threat of irreversible toxicities like chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with a > 80% lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer. 76 Whereas the prior U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of pembrolizumab in high microsatellite instability metastatic colorectal cancer in 2017 had required " progress[ion] following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, " with the advent of

KEYNOTE-177 in 2020, patients with Lynch syndrome could finally be treated with a truly chemotherapy-free approach, mitigating their greatest risk of cancer-related death while better preserving quality of life. 77

## ROLE OF HIF2 a INHIBITOR BELZUTIFAN IN THE TREATMENT OF VHL SYNDROME Von Hippel-Lindau Disease and Biology

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a hereditary autosomal dominant syndrome caused by a germline mutation and/or deletion of the VHL gene. 38 The disease is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of HIFs transcription factors that lead to the transcription of proangiogenic and metabolic genes resulting in the development of tumors and cysts in multiple organs, including the brain, kidney, pancreas, and adrenal glands, among others. It has been shown that the small molecule HIF2 a inhibitor belzutifan (MK6482) has significant efficacy in renal cell carcinomas, hemangioblastomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that are associated with VHL syndrome, while also exhibiting an acceptable safety profile. 78 In this section, we briefly describe the biologic rationale and studies that led to the development of belzutifan for patients with VHL, which has been discussed in detail in our previous review. 38

The VHL gene resides on chromosome 3p25-26, 20 and deletion or inactivation of both alleles is necessary for tumor development. 79 The most well-studied function of the pVHL is its function as E3 ubiquitin ligase as part of the VCB complex with partners including elongin B, elongin C, cullin 2, and RBX1. 80 -82 Hypoxia inducible factors are the first of the many targets of the VCB complex that have been identified. 14 , 83 , 84 The interaction of VHL and HIFs is dependent on the hydroxylation of proline residues on HIFs ' oxygen-dependent degradation domain. 85 -87 During the normoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) hydroxylate proline residues on HIFs that allow for pVHL recognition, followed by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. 30 , 88 -90 Physiologically, when cells lack oxygen in a hypoxic environment, PHDs are unable to hydroxylate proline residues and therefore, pVHL is unable to recognize HIFs essential for ubiquitination. Similarly, in VHL syndrome or sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, lack of functional pVHL causes buildup of HIFs in the cytoplasm. 85 , 86 , 91 -93 Accumulated HIFs form a heterodimer with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, which then translocates to the nucleus to promote angiogenic, metabolic gene expression (i.e., VEGF, GLUT1, GLUT3, hexokinase 2, etc.) necessary for cell survival in a hypoxic environment. 94 -97 Due to the lack of functional pVHL, the unnecessary overproduction of these genes in nonhypoxic environment contributes to the tumorigenesis in VHL syndrome and sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. With this pathogenic mechanism, tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor

receptors have been extensively studied and approved for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. 98 , 99

## Development of HIF2 a Inhibitor Belzutifan for VHL Disease Treatment

In VHL disease, sunitinib, pazopanib, and dovitinib were tested in clinical trials. A pilot study of sunitinib on 15 patients with VHL demonstrated the drug is safe and achieved 33% partial response in evaluated kidney tumors, but no response in other VHL-related lesions. 100 Dovitinib was tested in another pilot study and after the enrollment of six patients, the study was stopped per toxicity stopping rules. The best response was stable disease. 101 In a phase II study of pazopanib, 31 patients with VHL were treated and had 52% ORR in renal cell carcinoma, 4% ORR in hemangioblastoma, and 53% ORR in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor lesions. 102 In all these studies, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, and nausea were the most common tyrosine kinase inhibitor-related side effects. Additionally, in pazopanib study, 67% of the patients had elevated transaminases requiring dose reduction. Given the paucity of clinical efficacy tyrosine kinase inhibitors and adverse event profiles, there was a need for the development of better systemic therapy agents with higher efficacy and more tolerable side effects. Although for many years, it was known that HIF2 a is the tumor oncogene that contributes most to the renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma, 91 , 103 , 104 it was considered to be nondruggable until the identification of 290-Å 3 internal cavity within the HIF2 a PAS-B domain required for the interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. 105 -107 Subsequent studies led to the discovery of first-generation HIF2 a inhibitors. 108 -114 The first HIF2 a inhibitor, PT2385, was tested in a phase I study had limited efficacy (14% ORR) given the extensive glucuronidation of the drug in the enterocytes with the UGT2B17 enzyme. Therefore, investigators modified the germinal difluoro group of PT2385 to the vicinal difluoro group, which resulted in decreased glucuronidation and improved pharmacokinetics. 115 The new compound PT2977 (MK-6482, belzutifan) had higher potency and was tested in further studies.

Based on the phase I dose-escalation study in 34 patients with advanced solid tumors, 120-mg daily was defined as the recommended phase II dose. 115 In a multinational, phase II, single-arm, open-label study, 61 patients with VHL disease and clear cell renal cell carcinoma were treated with belzutifan 120-mg daily. 78 The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the ORR in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. At the median 21.8 months follow-up, 49.2% of the patients had partial response in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and 98.4% of the patients had disease control. Secondary endpoints of the study were safety, duration of response, time to response, PFS, and the efficacy of belzutifan in retinal and central nervous system

hemangioblastoma, pancreatic lesions. The median time to response was 8.2 months (range, 2.7 -19.1). The median duration of response was not reached at the time of evaluation. The PFS rate at 24 months was 96% (95% CI, 87 -99). Among 61 patients with pancreatic lesions, 77% had ORR, including 10% with complete response. Among 50 patients with central nervous system hemangioblastoma, 30% had ORR. There were 12 patients in the study with retinal hemangioblastoma, and all had improvement at the time of the data cutoff. Regarding safety, the drug was overall well-tolerated with manageable side effects, including the most common adverse events such as anemia, fatigue, headache, and dizziness ( Table 1 ). The majority of the adverse events were at grade 1 and 2 levels, and only 15% of the patients required dose reduction due to adverse events ( Table 2 ). Based on these study results, on August 13, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved belzutifan for adult patients with VHL syndrome who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system hemangioblastoma, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery. 39

## Belzutifan for the Treatment of Sporadic Renal Cell Carcinoma

In the dose-escalation phase of the phase I study ( NCT02974738 ), 43 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. 116 At doses up to 160 mg daily, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The recommended phase II dose was decided as 120-mg once daily. In the dose-expansion cohort, 55 patients with sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma were treated. Sixty-two percent of patients

had more than three lines of prior therapy, and 80% of patients progressed on immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite the heavy previous treatment history of the study population, the ORR with belzutifan was 25%. Additionally, 54% of the patients had stable disease. The ORR was comparable across different IMDC groups, with 31% in the favorable risk group and 24% in the intermediate/ poor risk group. The median duration of response was not reached at the time of data cutoff. The median PFS was 14.5 months. Regarding the safety profile, the most common adverse events were anemia (76%), fatigue (71%), dyspnea (49%), nausea (36%), cough (31%), and hypoxia (31%). Sixty-seven percent of the patients with anemia received exogenous erythropoietin, and 36% underwent blood transfusions. Hypoxia was usually managed with supplemental oxygen. In severe cases of hypoxia, two patients required dose reduction and discontinuation of the treatment. No treatment-related grade 4 or 5 events occurred. In this study, belzutifan demonstrating antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma encouraged more studies in different settings and combinations. Belzutifan is currently being tested for adjuvant, metastatic first-line, and after progression on immune checkpoint inhibitors ( Table 4 ). Different regimens are also under investigation, including combinations with pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab + lenvatinib, cabozantinib, and abemaciclib.

## CONCLUSIONS

Here we described the landmark studies that led to the approval of HIF2 a inhibitors in VHL syndrome, anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab in high microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer and solid tumors, and

PARPi in breast and pancreatic cancer. Developing these drugs for the hereditary cancer syndromes is the product of more than 100 years of cumulative efforts of physicians and scientists who have contributed for the establishing clinical diagnosis, discovering the biologic mechanisms of disease that led to these novel drug developments in recent years. It is necessary to note that, although these hereditary cancer syndromes include less than 5% of all malignancies, in light of the biologic and clinical knowledge gained from developing these drugs for the neoplastic syndromes, the investigation and application of these gents has expanded in sporadic cancers with similar mechanisms.

HIF2 a inhibitor, belzutifan, is under investigation for sporadic renal cell carcinoma. 38 PARP inhibitors have been approved for prostate cancer with sporadic BRCA alterations or other DNA damage gene defects. 64 , 117 , 118 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved as for the treatment of colorectal cancer with sporadic high microsatellite instability or mismatch repair deficient tumors. 119 , 120 These studies serve as a model for and encourage further clinical and biologic research on other rare cancer syndromes that may benefit both those patients and other sporadic cancers with similar underlying pathologic mechanisms.
