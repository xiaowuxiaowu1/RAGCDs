Distributing Representative and Diverse Datasets: The representativeness and quality of the datasets used for training have a significant impact on the efficacy of AI models. International cooperation makes it easier to share a variety of datasets across a broad spectrum of racial and ethnic backgrounds and therapeutic settings. The AI community can produce models that are more resilient, generalizable, and suitable to a worldwide patient population by combining resources and exchanging data across national boundaries [55].

Bringing Regulatory Standards into Unison: Different countries have different regulatory environments when it comes to AI in healthcare, which presents difficulties for academics, developers, and healthcare practitioners. International cooperation provides a chance to standardize regulatory requirements, resulting in a more efficient and uniform framework for the authorization and use of AI applications in cancer treatment [56]. This alignment can improve the speed at which innovations are introduced to the global market and lower entry barriers for developers.

Creating Ethical Standards: AI in healthcare raises complicated ethical issues that call for a nuanced response. Working together can help build international ethical standards that cover topics like algorithmic bias, transparency, and data protection [57]. A uniform code of ethics for cancer treatment will be followed when ethical principles are agreed upon, ensuring that AI technologies are used responsibly.

Fostering Cooperation and Information Sharing: AI systems must be able to communicate with a variety of healthcare infrastructures in order to be seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows. Standardized protocols and interfaces can be developed through international collaboration, facilitating effective data sharing and interoperability between various healthcare systems [58]. The significance of interoperability increases when AI applications transcend national boundaries and adjust to the distinct requirements of diverse healthcare settings.

Encouraging Training and Knowledge Exchange: A key component of international cooperation is knowledge exchange, which promotes the sharing of skills, best practices, and lessons discovered. Healthcare practitioners, academics, and developers from many locations can share thoughts on using artificial intelligence (AI) in cancer medicine through collaborative platforms. Global perspectives might be advantageous for training programs and educational campaigns, guaranteeing that practitioners throughout the world have the abilities required to properly utilize AI technology [59].

Combining Resources for Development and Research: Comprehensive funding and skills are needed for the research and development of AI applications in cancer medicine. International cooperation makes it possible to pool resources, which encourages collaborative research projects and multi-center investigations. By pooling their
