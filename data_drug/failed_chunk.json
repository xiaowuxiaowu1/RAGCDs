(2019) assessed the efficacy of enterococci phages in an in vitro biofilm wound model and found that phages could target and disrupt both active and dormant bacterial cells within biofilms [145].\n\nBiofilm dispersal: Some phages can induce biofilm dispersal by triggering bacterial cells to produce enzymes like dispersin B, which promotes the detachment of bacteria from the biofilm matrix.

This specificity helps to minimize dysbiosis, a common side effect associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. According to Pires et al. (2022), the precise targeting of phages reduces collateral damage and preserves the balance of the host's microbiota, making phage therapy a more selective and potentially safer alternative to traditional antibiotics [153].\n\nSelf-replication: One of the key benefits of phage therapy is its auto-dosing capability. Phages replicate at the site of infection as long as there are susceptible bacteria present, providing sustained antibacterial activity. This self-replicating property decreases the need for frequent administration and ensures a prolonged therapeutic effect. Wang et al.",

For the last two decades, contemporary medicine has identified and isolated potent active isomeric compounds. Multi-target therapies were a novel notion in the mid-2000s, but they will be one of the more critical advancements in developing drugs in 2021. Target-based drug development for effective natural anticancer therapeutics based on well-defined fragments is being researched instead of naturally occurring combinations. This paper highlights computeraided/fragment-based structure deconstruction and an inter method for natural anticancer medicines. The use of computer-aided drug development has increased (CADD).

It consists of the following two networks: the generative network G, which is used to fit the data distribution, and the discriminative network D, which is used to determine whether the input is \"real\" or not. In the training process, the generative network G tries to \"cheat\" D by accepting random noise to imitate the real images in the training set, while D tries to distinguish the real data from the output of the generative network as much as possible, thus forming a game process between the two networks.",

One of the biologic reasons for homologous recombination recovery is the predominance of cancer cell clones that carry BRCA reversion mutations that restore the reading frame and translate a functional protein. These cancer cell clones seem to arise from Darwinian selection under selective therapeutic pressure, which is expected to be less frequent in treatment-naïve patients with BRCA -associated breast cancer. Together with the favorable safety profile of PARPi, an\n\nincreased interest in assessing the clinical efficacy of PARPi in the neoadjuvant setting arose.",

Although the potential significance of the peripheral nervous system in oncogenesis was suggested by pioneers in the field last century, the functional\n\ncontribution of nerves to cancer development and modulation of the TME have remained under-explored for a long time.",

It is possible to secure IP protection for a newly repurposed medical use of a known drug molecule in most of the major pharmaceutical markets, provided that the new medical use is novel and inventive (i.e., non-obvious). However, many potential repurposing uses are already known in the scientific literature, which limits the potential for securing patent protection for the repurposed context. 58 In certain cases, even when a drug has demonstrated promising results, its market entry can be hindered due to conflicts associated with IP rights.",

Further animal studies and clinical trials are necessary. Moreover, there is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers to guide the entire treatment process. Since the situation with combination therapies differs from monotherapy, in addition to regular imaging tests, some blood test indicators also need to be clearly redefined to accurately describe the patient ' s treatment response. For patients, combination therapies inevitably increase drug costs. In the future, how to reduce the cost of combination therapies will also be an important issue for drug combination strategies.",

This section explores the ethical dilemmas inherent in AI-driven cancer medicine and proposes strategies for addressing them in a responsible and ethical manner. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cancer medicine raises a number of ethical considerations and dilemmas that must be carefully addressed to ensure patient safety, autonomy, and justice [41].",

Since many AI models function as \"black boxes,\" or opaque internal workings that are hard to understand, clinicians and patients may find it difficult to understand how AI algorithms arrive at their recommendations, raising questions about clinical autonomy, trust, and accountability. In order to allay these worries, efforts should be made to improve the explain ability and transparency of AI algorithms in the field of cancer medicine. The goal of explainable AI (XAI) approaches is to shed light on the decision-making procedures of black-box models, giving patients and physicians a better understanding of how AI recommendations are made.",

The survival rate over 5 years for patients with advanced stage lung cancer remains below 15% despite the diversity of therapeutic treatments and very important progress in the last two decades [2]. Treatment options mainly rely on surgery, complemented with radiotherapy, targeted chemotherapy, or immunotherapy, thanks to the development of specific markers of response [3]. The 5 year survival rate improves to 61.2% when diagnosis is performed at the stage of localized tumor, but drops to 9.9% when cancer is detected at the metastatic stage [4].

Incorporating TME components into cancer organoid models could be of great relevance especially for some cancer types, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which normally includes up to 90% of the stroma component in the tumor mass. To fill this gap, two culturing strategies have been developed [16,111]. In the first approach, the TME is reconstructed by co-culturing well-established organoids with exogenous stroma cells, such as native or reconstituted autologous CAFs or different types of immune cells [109,112].

This is well illustrated by the two examples described above and can be viewed as exploring the intrinsic value of the therapeutic portfolio. Regarding the advantages of repurposing, several considerations are important. Firstly, the advent of new technologies has enabled a thorough systematic approach to identify new indications for existing drugs. Secondly, the starting point of a novel repurposed drug is a portfolio of well-characterized molecules that have already been tested, approved and used in humans, albeit in different doses, routes of administration or formulations.

However, considerable effort remains to be done in terms of commitment to change, investment in resources and technology, education and training of various stakeholders, and assisting them in understanding legal and regulatory barriers, as well as logistics using new tools. Investing in this effort will increase\n\nconfidence and rigor in data integrity, data protection, dataflow , and trial complexity enabled by DCT solutions.\n\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank all the patients and investigators who participated in this survey and Schlesinger Group for assistance to conduct the survey.",

Selenium and selenium-containing compounds continue to be topics of substantial interest in the fields of biochemistry, epidemiology, and pharmacology. Numerous diseases that are now known to be linked to selenium deficiency have historically affected specific groups [19,20]. When considering medicinal uses, it is vitally important to manage the right amount and the right molecular types of selenium-based pharmaceuticals. It is important to note that more than 40 years ago, the idea that selenium might have a preventive effect against human cancer was explored in mainstream scientific literature [21,22].",

Berlin found that drugs approved under the priority review were twice as likely to have labeling revisions after FDA approval than those approved under standard review [111].

Interestingly, several Pol IIIdependent RNA components localizing to the PNC do not conform to their canonical RNP complexes, located elsewhere in the cell. Another non-coding RNA critical for PNC structure and function is the Pol I transcript PNCTR. The PNC also hosts various protein regulators of cellular RNA metabolism. These factors do not necessarily form their conventional functional complexes within this compartment. It is possible that repetitive RNAs sequester proteins like PTBP1 or CDK13, thus hindering their normal functions and promoting carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, RMRP is detected in a large protein complex with PTBP1 and CUGBP2 in PNCs, spatially separated from the newly synthesized RNA.",

[26] Negative selection screening should identify the loss of key genotypes or phenotypes in experimental datasets. This is a more challenging screening setup, because a trial aims to find the rarer event, which is dependent upon high penetrance of gene disruption and usually results in complex datasets where the signal-to-noise ratio is high.

The thyroid engages in complex interactions with viral infections through hormonal and immunoregulatory signaling molecules (28). Tumor cells usually induce immune system dysfunction, characterized by impaired T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and decreased T-cell proliferation. These changes make cancer patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (29). Thus, the severity of COVID-19 depends on inflammatory and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 (10) (Table 1) .\n\n## STRATEGIES FOR SURVEILLANCE AND DIAGNOSIS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nPatients with thyroid cancer usually have no symptoms and occasionally find nodules during physical examinations.",

After this step, a tubular space is formed. Many studies have demonstrated that the inner surface of the microchannel can be lined with epithelial cells, forming a confluent cell monolayer for vascularization ( Nguyen et al., 2013 ; Wong et al., 2013 ). Stainless steel needles are widely used as the template.",

Some of these methods involve forming vascular channels on microfluidic devices before combining them with tumor models, whereas other methods, such as bioprinting, involve construction of vessels in 3D tumor models before connection to microfluidic channels.\n\n## Microfabrication techniques: Photolithography and soft lithography\n\nPhotolithography is a well-known technique that has been frequently used for patterning proteins and cells. It can be used to produce patterns with features smaller than 1 μ m( Park and Shuler, 2003 ). Kane and colleagues developed an alternative technique called soft lithography, using elastomeric materials for pattern transfer ( Kane et al., 1999 ).",

Studies have been performed to clearly reproduce the spatial relationship between nascent lymphatic vessels and blood vessels in tumor tissues. Localization of individual tumor cells, as well as reproduction of tumor cells entering and leaving lymphatic vessels and blood vessels, has been achieved on tumor-on-a-chip platforms. There have also been many advances regarding drug diffusion and efficacy assessment in tumor tissues based on tumor-on-a-chip platforms.

It encompasses not only dramatic changes in drug applications but also more subtle adaptations that reveal previously unnoticed therapeutic potential. The overarching goal is to explore the utility of repurposing from a practical standpoint, recognising that this strategy can manifest in various forms. While drug repurposing often refers to the repositioning of off-patent FDA-approved drugs to new clinical indications, it can also include the repositioning of failed and patented drugs. As such, potential repurposing candidates fall into one of the following classes: generic, patented, and failed drugs, each of which have their own associated advantages and constraints [21].\n\nGeneric drugs refer to those which are off patent, approved by regulatory agencies, and typically readily available in pharmacies.",

In signature matching screens, the proteomic, metabolomic, and genomic signatures of cancer cells can be compared with those of drug-treated cells, allowing the prediction of which drugs are most likely to be effective against the pathology by reversing dysregulation and restoring a healthy -omics profile [26].

The primary basis for including metformin was its known antineoplastic effects observed in epidemiologic and retrospective studies [96]. However, to enhance the credibility of this decision, a more\n\nFig. 3 Rationale for combination therapy in oncology.

This should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms of action of metformin in this cancer and assessing its synergy with concurrent treatments, different dosages of metformin should be explored to identify the most effective and tolerable regimen.\n\nThere is a need for more emphasis on running clinical trials for repurposed drugs in combination with other drugs for cancer treatment, as combination therapy has the potential to be more effective than single-agent therapy [72]. There have been some successful clinical trials exploring combination therapy with repurposed drugs -for example the CUSP9v3 regimen, a cocktail of nine drugs involved in the coordinated undermining of survival pathways utilised in GB [97].",

One of the main reasons for this slower uptake is the presence of various barriers, particularly those related to financial aspects, that have not yet been effectively addressed [99]. The existing business model of pharmaceutical companies plays a significant role in this situation, as they heavily rely on the returns generated from investments in research, development, and marketing of new drugs once they are approved for clinical use [21]. Typically, these financial returns are achieved by obtaining market exclusivity for their drugs, which allows them to market the drugs at high prices without facing competition [100].

In the USA, this form of market exclusivity that typically lasts for five years for a new chemical entity, seven years for an orphan drug, and only three years for new indications of existing drugs [99]. The most common pathway to achieving this exclusivity for new indications utilises previous pharmacology and toxicology studies and only requires new information regarding safety and efficacy for the new indication [99].",

These collaborations are promising in this developing field, although some argue that collaborations are limited by extensive negotiation of technology transfer, data access, and IP rights [108]. However, as open-access data and collaboration become more common in the post-COVID-19 climate [109], efficient drug repurposing may be closer on the horizon.\n\nTo facilitate drug development for neglected or rare diseases, there are several options available from an IP perspective [110], including patent pools, open licensing, and allowing academic institutions and staff to participate in patent ownership for new medical uses [110, 111]. In addition, new funding models are emerging that involve venture capitals, public funding, and nonfor-profit organisations.",

By casting a wider net that covers a substantial portion of cancer cases, this strategy offers the promise of more accessible and effective cancer therapies. While personalised treatment remains an important avenue of research [121], the development of such broadly applicable drug combinations can significantly extend our ability to impact the lives of cancer patients. Furthermore, we anticipate that drug repurposing will be a key strategy in the prevention of cancer in at-risk but otherwise healthy population, an issue which is becoming an increasingly important public health concern. The testing of combination therapy, which would focus on the numerous compromised cellular pathways, would be more appropriate for\n\n712\n\nmany cancer patients [125].",

        "text": "Expensive cancer drugs are a burden on society in two ways: they impose high costs on those funding treatment (patients/insurance/state), and they stifle the development of equally effective but more affordable alternatives. The need for less costly alternatives is particularly dire in cases where the benefit of new therapies is marginal, as the costeffectiveness ratio is often unfavourable. The high cost of cancer drugs is therefore unsustainable, and innovative solutions are urgently needed to address this burgeoning issue.\n\nThere are several potential benefits of drug repurposing for cancer with combination therapies; less toxicity, greater effectiveness, reduced dosage at an equivalent or higher level of effectiveness [119], and the potential to combat drug resistance in current cancer therapies [124]. Furthermore, contrary to de novo development, drug repurposing is a cost-effective and timesaving method for increasing the number of clinically available cancer treatments [30].",

The notion that research groups should exclusively focus on discovering \" superior \" therapies and disregard more affordable alternatives is no longer valid, primarily due to the exorbitant prices of novel cancer drugs. Ultimately, the current high cost of novel cancer drugs is unsustainable, especially when the benefits of these new therapies are minimal at best. In such cases, the costeffectiveness ratio of these drugs is unfavourable, emphasising the pressing need for less expensive alternatives like drug repurposing.",
