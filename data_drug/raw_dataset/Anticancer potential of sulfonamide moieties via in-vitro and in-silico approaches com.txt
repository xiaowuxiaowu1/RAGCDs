Abstract: Several kinds of anticancer drugs are presently commercially accessible, but low efficacy, solubility, and toxicity have reduced the overall therapeutic indices. Thus, the search for promising anticancer drugs continues. The interactions of numerous essential anticancer drugs with DNA are crucial to their biological functions. Here, the anticancer effects of N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) and 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulphonamide ( 8b ) on cell lines from breast and cervical cancer were investigated. The study also compared how these substances interacted with the hearing sperm DNA. The most promising anticancer drug was identified as 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ), which showed GI$\_{50}$ of 7.2 ± 1.12 µ M, 4.62 ± 0.13 µ M and 7.13 ± 0.13 µ M against HeLa, MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. Moreover, it also exhibited significant electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to the binding free energy. The work utilized computational techniques, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, to demonstrate the strong cytotoxicity of 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfamide ( 8b ) in comparison to standard Doxorubicin and cisplatin, respectively. Molecular docking experiments provided additional support for a role for the minor groove in the binding of the 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfamide ( 8b )-DNA complex. The molecular docking studies and MD simulation showed that both compounds revealed comparable inhibitory potential against standard Doxorubicin and cisplatin. This study has the potential to lead to the discovery of new bioactive compounds for use in cancer treatment, including metallic and non-metallic derivatives of 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ). It also emphasizes the worth of computational approaches in the development of new drugs and lays the groundwork for future research.

## 1. Introduction

One-in-four fatalities in the United States is caused by cancer, making it the secondleading cause of mortality in the country. Because of its high mortality rate, cancer has been the subject of intensive research to find effective anticancer drugs. Current improvements in oncology have resulted in improved cancer treatment outcomes and increased survival rates [1]. Yet issues like drug resistance, toxicity, and ineffectiveness continue to drive the demand for innovative anticancer therapy [2]. Despite initial success in treating localized cancer, the disease often spreads to other parts of the body [3]. In developing countries, breast cancer is the leading cause of death. New tumors, unusual bleeding, a persistent cough, unexplained weight loss, and changes in bowel habits are all potential cancer signs and symptoms [4,5]. Available anticancer therapies may not always be successful due to

Among the methods under investigation include immunotherapy, gene therapy, and medicines based on nanotechnology. These strategies aim to decrease toxicity, boost therapeutic efficacy, and overcome resistance by more precisely targeting cancer cells [6,7]. The exact molecular interactions of some DNA-acting anticancer medicines with DNA have been studied using structural methods such as high-resolution X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy throughout the past decade [8]. Important details about DNA conformation and interactions between drugs and DNA have been revealed by these findings.

Covalent bonds are created between DNA and substances like cisplatin, Mitomycin C, and ecteinascidins. Last but not least, some antibiotics can cause DNA backbone cleavages (for instance, duocarmycin, bleomycin/phleomycin, and enediyne) [8,10,11].

A hydrogen bond network comparable to that produced by the carboxylic group may be generated by the sulfonamide motif. Additionally, the distance between oxygen atoms in both of these functional groups is nearly identical [14,15]. As the carboxylic group's bioisostere, it may avoid some of the carboxylic group's drawbacks, such as limited passive diffusion across biological membranes, toxicity, and metabolic instability [16]. A broad range of sulfonamide derivatives (Figure 1) have been developed, with biological actions ranging from anti-bacterial to anti-fungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anti-cancer [17,18].

In this study, a combination of in-vitro and in-silico methodologies was used to evaluate the anti-cancer potential of two sulphonamide compounds, with a focus on their interactions with three critical cancer proteins: p53, caspase, and NFκ B. This research also draws a tt ention to p53, caspases, and NFκ B as important players in the progression of cancer and prospective therapeutic targets. p53 targeting is a promising strategy for the development of anti-cancer drugs since mutations in this gene are linked to many different types of cancer [20-22].

Possible modes of action and anticancer potential of N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) and 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulphonamide ( 8b ) were assessed by experimental and computational methodologies. The studied compounds' cytotoxicity was evaluated by in-vitro cell line experiments. This involves exposing cancer cells to the drug candidate and measuring its effect on cell growth and viability. Computational methods and invitro experiments were used to examine the compounds' properties and their predicted interactions with proteins involved in cancer. Molecular docking was used to estimate the binding modes and affinities of drug candidates with target proteins (p53, caspase, and NFκ B). The electrical structure and properties were fine-tuned with the use of density functional theory (DFT). Time-dependent changes in protein-ligand interactions were studied using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to learn more about the stability of protein-ligand complexes. Thus, combined, in-vitro and computational investigations improved our understanding of the potential efficacy and mechanism of action of possible anticancer lead compounds.

In this study, two compounds, N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) and 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ) , were analyzed for their inhibitory potential. The optimization energy, polarizability, dipole moment, potential ionization energy, affinity energy, electron-donating power, electron-accepting power, and electrophilicity were determined for both compounds. Compound ( 8a ) was found to have an optimization energy of - 953.809912 Hartree, a polarizability of 300.221 a.u, a dipole moment of 6.201887 Debye, and a potential ionization energy of 0.258 eV. It was determined that ( 8a ) had an electron receiving the power of 0.246 and an electron-donating power of 0.199. In addition, 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ) was found to have a higher optimization energy of - 2075.743816 Hartree, a lower polarizability of 110.149294 a.u, a dipole moment of 3.618891 Debye, and a potential ionization energy of 0.2711 eV. The electrondonating power of 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ) was found to be 0.261, while its electron-accepting power was 0.346. The electrophilicity of both compounds was calculated as the difference between the electron-donating and electron-accepting power, with N-Ethyltoluene-4-sulfonamide ( 8a ) having a D ω ± value of 0.047, while Compound 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ) has a D ω ± value of 0.085. The electrostatic potential map of the compound highlights regions of high and low electrostatic potential. The red areas have high electron-attracting potential because of the electronegative oxygen atoms present. The blue areas have a lesser electron-donating potential, possibly because of the presence of hydrogen atoms. These maps provide crucial insight into a molecule's electron reactivity and distribution (Figure 4).

The compounds, ( 8a ) and ( 8b ), were analyzed to determine their electronic properties. The results suggest that 8a had a HOMO energy of - 0.258 eV and a LUMO energy of - 0.046 eV with a band gap of 0.211 eV. On the other hand, 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3sulfonamide ( 8b ) had a HOMO energy of - 0.271 eV and a LUMO energy of - 0.080 eV, yielding a band gap of 0.191 eV. The energy needed to excite an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO level is measured by the band gap of a molecule, which is a significant parameter in determining its electrical conductivity.

The chemical hardness ( η ) was measured as 0.106 eV and 0.096 eV for ( 8a ) and ( 8b ), respectively. The lower the value of chemical hardness, the higher the reactivity will be. The chemical potential ( µ ) (a measure of the ability of a molecule to donate electrons) for ( 8a ) was - 0.152 eV, while that of ( 8b ) was - 0.176 eV. The electrophilicity index ( ω ) of N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) was 0.110 eV, while that of 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3sulfonamide ( 8b ) was 0.161 eV. The electrophilicity index quantifies a molecule's propensity to receive electrons, with a greater number indicating a stronger tendency to do so. The chemical softness (S) of ( 8a ) was 4.736 eV and that of ( 8b ) was 5.233 eV. Chemical softness is a measure of the ability of a molecule to undergo chemical reactions, with higher values indicating a higher reactivity.

The electrophilicity index ( ω ) of Nethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) was 0.110 eV, while that of 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3) was 0.161 eV. The electrophilicity index quantifies a molecule's propensity to receive electrons, with a greater number indicating a stronger tendency to do so. The chemical softness (S) of ( 8a ) was 4.736 eV and that of ( 8b ) was 5.233 eV. Chemical The orbital study of ( 8a ) reveals that the sulphonamide group is the primary contributor of HOMO, with help from the hydrophobic benzene ring and the methyl group. The LUMO is primarily localized on the toluene ring, which gives the compound an electrophilic character. In compound ( 8b ), the HOMO orbitals are primarily located on the dichloro-substituted thiophene ring, while the LUMO orbitals are mainly located on the sulphonamide fragment of the molecule, with some slight delocalization also observed on the thiophene ring. These findings provide information about the electrical structure and chemical reactivity of these molecules (Figure 5).

These interactions are critical for stabilizing the complex and enhancing the binding affinity. In contrast, weak binding affinities were observed for the NFκ B-cisplatin, Caspase 3-cisplatin, and DNA-cisplatin complexes, with fewer hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions identified. These results suggest that these complexes may not be ideal drug targets; further optimization of the ligands or target proteins may be required to improve binding affinity. These results provide valuable information about anticancer potential and mode of action for ( 8a ) and ( 8b ) (Table 4).

## Interpretation of Molecular Interactions

Molecular docking analysis was used to assess the nature of the interaction between ( 8a ) and Caspase-3. The binding energy of compound ( 8a ) to Caspase-3 was calculated to be - 4.9 kcal/mol. The interaction involved one hydrogen bond with the asparagine residue Asn208 (3.5 Å bond length). Additionally, hydrophobic interactions were observed with multiple residues, including Asp253, Trp206, Arg207, Trp214, Asn208, Phe247, Glu246, Glu248, Phe250, Phe252, and Ser251. These interactions could be crucial in ensuring the stability of ( 8a ) binding to Caspase-3.

The hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between ( 8a ) and Caspase-3 indicated that the compound could be a lead molecule for the development of new Caspase3 inhibitors. Caspase-3 is an essential protein involved in the apoptosis process and has an important role in carcinogenesis. Compound ( 8a ) showed promising cancer cell growth inhibition after creating a complex with the Caspase-3 enzyme. Once the complex is established with Caspase-3, the protein's function may be inhibited (Figure 6).

The ligand established hydrogen bonding with the Asn17, Gln23, and Arg10 residues, with a bond length of 2.69, 3.20, and 3.18 angstroms, respectively. Furthermore, several hydrophobic interactions were noticed with Glu89, Ile22, Lys20, Tyr92, Cys114, Arg203, and Pro231 residues. These interactions are crucial for stabilizing the protein-ligand complex and enhancing its binding affinity.

strong interaction between the two molecules. The ligand created hydrogen bonds with His121, Gly122, and Leu168 residues, with a bond length of 3.24, 2.2, and 2.96 angstroms, respectively. Several hydrophobic interactions were also observed with Leu168, Phe256, Thr166, and Thr255 residues. Hydrogen bonding interactions play a significant role in stabilizing the protein-ligand complex. These bonds form when a hydrogen atom of the ligand interacts with an electronegative atom of the protein residue, such as nitrogen or oxygen. Such interactions are essential in maintaining the ligand's orientation and conformation within the protein's active site. Hydrophobic interactions also play a crucial role in protein-ligand binding, as they contribute to the overall stability of the complex. These interactions occur between nonpolar regions of the ligand and protein residues, such as aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Hydrophobic interactions also contribute to the specificity of ligand binding, as specific protein residues may have unique hydrophobic pockets that only interact with specific ligands.

The presented Figure 13 below showcases the results of molecular docking analysis for three distinct protein-ligand complexes: p53-cisplatin, NFκ B-cisplatin, and Caspase 3-cisplatin. The docking score reflects the strength of the binding affinity between the ligand, cisplatin, and its respective protein complex. Regarding the p53-cisplatin complex, the docking score was - 3.27 kcal/mol, indicating a moderate interaction between the two molecules. The ligand showed hydrogen bonding with Asn17, Ile21, and Phe16 residues, with a bond length of 3.34, 2.98, and 3.32 angstroms, respectively. Additionally, several hydrophobic interactions occurred with Leu20, Ile22, and Gln23 residues. These interactions contribute to the stabilization of the protein-ligand complex, thus strengthening the binding affinity. As for the NFκ B-cisplatin complex, the docking score was - 2.38 kcal/mol, indicating a weak interaction between the two molecules. No hydrogen bonding residues were observed for this complex. Nevertheless, several hydrophobic interactions took place with Leu674, Ile673, Leu736, Asn698, and Asn669 residues. In the case of the Caspase 3-cisplatin complex, the docking score was - 2.57 kcal/mol, also indicating a weak interaction between the two molecules. No hydrogen bonding residues were found for this complex either. However, several hydrophobic interactions occurred with Phe256, Thr255, Tyr204, Leu168, and Phe256 residues.

The hydrophobic interactions were found with deoxycytidine (Dc9), deoxyadenosine (Da18), deoxythymidine (Dt20), and deoxythymidine (Dt8). These results indicate that Compound N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) can interact with the DNA molecule, potentially affecting its structure and function. In addition, Compound N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) was completely buried inside the DNA helix, which demonstrates a strong intercalation of DNA. Such interactions could have implications for the use of ( 8a ) in the treatment of diseases involving DNA, such as cancer. To fully comprehend, additional research is required to establish the mechanism of action of ( 8a ) to DNA (Figure 14).

The formation of these hydrogen bonds is critical for stabilizing the complex and promoting a stronger binding affinity between the two molecules. In addition, the analysis also detected several hydrophobic interactions between Doxorubicin and DNA nucleotide residues, such as Deoxyadenosine (Da6), Deoxycytosine (Dc21), Deoxyadenosine (Da5), Deoxyguanosine (Dg4), and Deoxyguanosine (Dg22). These interactions played a crucial role in increasing the overall stability of the complex, leading to a higher binding affinity between the two molecules.

In the first 10 ns, the RMSD of the p53-( 8a ) complex was 1.8 Å, then it increased to a maximum of 2.8 Å before leveling off and reaching equilibrium. Variations in the RMSD values are indicative of conformational changes in the p53-( 8a ) complex that occurred during the simulation. While there were fluctuations, they were within a reasonable range, so the complex's overall stability was maintained (Figure 17).

In MMGBSA energy analysis, the free -binding energies of protein, ligand The MMGBSA (Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area) is a popular technique for predicting the binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes. This method determines the binding free energy by computing the difference between the free energies of the protein-ligand complex and the unbound components (i.e., the protein and the ligand). In MMGBSA energy analysis, the free-binding energies of protein, ligand, and the protein-ligand complex are estimated by the following equation [30]:

In this study, the Schrodinger Python script was used to calculate the binding free energies of four protein-ligand complexes, namely p53-cisplatin, p53-doxorubicin, p53-( 8a ), and caspase3-( 8b ). The results of the study show that the p53-( 8a ) complex has the lowest CFBE value of - 5508.8 kcal/mol, while the Caspase-38b complex has a slightly lower CFBE value of - 5822.1 kcal/mol. This implies that the interactions between the protein and ligand molecules in these two complexes are relatively weak. On the other hand, the CFBE values for the p53-Doxorubicin and p53-Cisplatin complexes are - 1022.6 kcal/mol and

,

- 1002 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that these complexes have stronger interactions. The data also provide information on the different energy components that contribute to the overall CFBE, including Columb, hydrogen bond, and covalent energies. Among the four complexes, p53-( 8a ) has the highest Columb energy ( - 8235.2 kcal/mol), indicating strong electrostatic interactions between the protein and ligand molecules. The highest hydrogen bond energy is observed in the p53-Doxorubicin complex ( - 420.2 kcal/mol), which suggests that the protein-ligand complex has strong hydrogen-bonding interactions. The covalent energy is the lowest for the p53-Cisplatin complex ( - 232.9 kcal/mol), indicating a relatively weak covalent interaction. In summary, the data provide valuable insights into the energetics of protein-ligand complexes, which can be used to understand the binding mechanism and guide the development of more effective ligands. However, it is important to exercise caution when interpreting the results as they are subject to various assumptions and approximations used in the calculations. The detailed values are provided in Table 5.

The binding energies of each amino acid residue of Caspase-3 and p53 are calculated; they range from - 1.0 to - 5.9 kcal/mol, as illustrated in Figure 21. It can be seen from the readings' oscillations between these two extremes that some residues have a higher affinity for binding than others. The variation in the residues' binding energies serves as a visual cue to the intricate nature of protein-ligand interactions. The shape, size, and chemical characteristics of the ligand and the protein surface, as well as the amino acid makeup of the protein's binding site, all have an impact on binding energy. , x FOR PEER REVIEW

the structure and operation of the protein Caspase -PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a statistical method for reducing the number of dimensions in a dataset while preserving the majority of the data. This is accomplished by locating the principal components, which are linear combinations of the initial variables that account for the majority of the variance in the data. PCA can be used to examine the structure and operation of the protein Caspase-3, which is a protease enzyme involved in apoptosis or programmed cell death (Figure 22).

- 3.3. Computational Investigations

## 3.3.1. Density Functional Theory Calculations

DFT calculations are widely used to study the electronic properties and structural stability of molecules. In this study, the DFT calculations were used to evaluate the electronic properties of N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) and 2,5-Dichlorothiophene3-sulfonamide ( 8b ) using the Gaussian 09W program [35,36]. The B3LYP functional correlation and the 6-31G* basis set were used to optimize the geometries and evaluate the stability of the compounds [37].

The electron density of the compounds was analyzed using local and global reactivity descriptors, as well as the frontier molecular orbitals [38]. The chemical sensitivity, ionization potential, and reactivity of the compounds were evaluated based on their electron densities. The findings indicated that the compounds had a high ion-attracting capacity and were promising ligand choices [39,40]. The GaussView 06 [41] analysis provided suitability as potential ligands through the assessment of their properties. In general, the DFT calculations elucidated useful information on the electrical characteristics and structural stability of the compounds, which might be used in the creation of effective anticancer medicines.

## 3.3.2. Molecular Docking Studies

Molecular docking was used to evaluate the non-covalent interactions of compounds N-ethyl toluene-4-sulphonamide ( 8a ) and 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ) as inhibitors against various cancer proteins, including Caspase-3, NFκ B, p53, and DNA. The study used proteins sourced from the Protein Data Bank (PDB: PDB IDs: 3DEI [42], 1NFI [43], 3DCY [44,45], and 127D [46] respectively, www.rcsb.com accessed on 15 February 2023) and prepared them for docking by removing water and hetero-atoms, adding polar hydrogen atoms, and incorporating Gasteiger charges [30,47]. The grid box of one angstrom spacing was set for molecular docking purposes. In addition, the attributes of co-crystal ligand were used for production run. The coordinates for the NFκ B protein were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and the x, y, and z attributes were set to - 5.373126, 65.514536, and 45.078298, respectively. The dimensions of the p53 protein were set to 17.000000, 41.837500, and - 3.621000, while the dimensions for the DNA were set to 9.927250, 23.023156, 8.770906 and - 46.798037, 15.020000, and - 21.901333 for Caspase 3. To learn how the ligand would attach to the enzyme's active site, the proteins' protonation states were also altered. Electrostatic interactions between the ligand and the protein are influenced by the protonation status of amino acids within the active site, which influences binding affinity and specificity. To obtain a precise depiction of the binding interactions, molecular docking, and MDS need to consider the protonation states of the protein and ligand in their analyses.

The compounds ( 8a ), ( 8b ), and standard doxorubicin and cisplatin were prepared for direct docking in AutoDock Vina [48]. The grid box was enlarged to include the targeted proteins' active sites. The exhaustiveness was set to Default 8, and the number of modes was set to 100 to obtain precise docking findings. The co-crystal ligand was docked to verify the docking procedure. If the RMSD between the original and rebuilt position was fewer than two angstroms, the docking method was considered successful [47].

## 3.3.3. Molecular Dynamics Simulations

MDS studies on the protein-ligand complex were performed on Desmond. Each complex was simulated in the TIP3P solvent model and was used for 50 ns. [49]. Restoration of the system to its original state was performed with counter sodium chloride (NaCl) ions 0.15 M. The OPLS3 forcefield was utilized during the simulation [50]. The atomic motion was integrated by this forcefield while it was being exposed to periodic boundary conditions. To prevent any collisions of atoms from occurring, an initial strategy of 2000 steps for minimizing energy was used. The system was brought to equilibrium in an isothermal and isobaric environment at 300 K and 1.01 bar (NPT) [51,52]. To focus on interactions at shorter ranges, van der Waals calculations were performed using a cutoff distance

of 10 angstroms. The Nose-Hoover thermostat and the Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat were employed to maintain pressure and temperature during the simulation [53]. When integrating the motion equations, a 2-fs time step was employed. The production run lasted 100 ns, and the simulated trajectories were saved at 50 ps intervals. Particle Mesh Ewald was used to investigate electrostatic interactions with high accuracy and reliability [54,55]. The Desmond simulation interaction diagram protocol was used to analyze the simulated trajectories of the protein-ligand complexes. The MM-GBSA and principle component analysis were performed as discussed earlier [30].

## 4. Conclusions

The free-binding energy is affected by both electrostatic and non-electrostatic forces, and Compound ( 8b ) was determined to have the greatest potential as an anticancer agent. Molecular docking studies suggest that Compound ( 8b ) has the strongest affinity for binding Caspase-3, while ( 8a ) has the strongest affinity for p53. DFT calculations that supported the findings demonstrated that both compounds have good chemical reactivity with the localization of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals at specific regions of the molecules, supporting the claim that 2,5-Dichlorothiophene-3-sulfonamide ( 8b ) is a potential anticancer compound. Docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations added further support to the stability of both compounds in their binding sites. Both compounds exhibited better docking scores than cisplatin and comparable docking scores to Doxorubicin. These results highlight the importance of integrating computational and experimental methods when developing novel therapies for the treatment of a wide range of diseases and also provide valuable information about the potential of these molecules as Caspase-3 and p53 inhibitors.
