## 1. Introduction

Phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections, has a history dating back to the early 20th century. Bacteriophages, or simply phages, are viruses that specifically infect bacteria. They were first discovered by Frederick Twort in 1915 and independently by F é lix d'H é relle in 1917, who observed their potential to eliminate bacterial cultures [1,2]. Despite their early promise, the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s led to a decline in phage research and application in the Western world. However, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has rekindled interest in phage therapy as a viable alternative or complement to traditional antibiotics [3-5]. The global health crisis posed by antibiotic resistance has prompted urgent calls for novel antimicrobial strategies. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycinresistant Enterococci (VRE), and extended-spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae represent significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Phage therapy offers a targeted approach to combat these pathogens. Unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics, phages are highly specific to their bacterial hosts, which minimizes the impact on beneficial microbiota and reduces the risk of collateral damage [6].

Phages have also demonstrated efficacy against biofilm-associated infections, which are notoriously difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics. Biofilms, which are structured communities of bacteria encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix, are implicated in chronic infections and are resistant to antibiotics and immune responses. Phages can penetrate biofilms, replicate within bacterial cells, and disrupt the biofilm matrix, making them potent agents against biofilm-associated infections [7]. In addition to treating extracellular bacteria, phage therapy is being explored for its potential to target intracellular pathogens. Intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella spp., reside within host cells, evading many antibiotics that cannot effectively penetrate cellular membranes. Advances in phage engineering and delivery mechanisms are opening new possibilities for using phages to combat these hidden infections [8].

While phage therapy has demonstrated significant promise in addressing bacterial infections, it represents only one facet of phage-based drug development. Phage-based drug development encompasses a diverse range of innovative applications beyond traditional phage therapy for bacterial infections [9,10]. Beyond their role in direct bacterial lysis, phages are being harnessed for various innovative applications, including vaccine development, cancer therapy, and as vectors for gene-delivery systems. Phage display technology, which involves expressing peptides or proteins on the surface of phage particles, has revolutionized vaccine development. This technology allows for the presentation of antigens in a highly immunogenic context, potentially leading to more effective vaccines [11,12]. In oncology, phages are being investigated as anti-cancer agents. By engineering phages to target tumor-specific markers, researchers aim to selectively deliver therapeutic agents to cancer cells, thereby minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Additionally, the immunogenic properties of phages can stimulate an anti-tumor immune response, offering a dual mechanism of action against cancer [13,14]. Phages also hold promise as drug-delivery systems (DDS) for gene therapy. Their ability to encapsulate and deliver genetic material to specific cells makes them ideal vectors for delivering therapeutic genes, including those used in CRISPR-Cas systems for gene editing. The specificity and efficiency of phage-mediated delivery systems could revolutionize the field of gene therapy [15,16]. A comprehensive overview of phage-facilitated medical and technological advancements is summarized in Table 1.

This broad scope of applications highlights the versatility of phages in addressing various medical challenges and underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to phage-based drug development.

Despite these promising applications, several challenges and regulatory hurdles must be addressed to fully realize the potential of phage-based therapies. Issues related to phage stability, immune response, and regulatory approval need careful consideration. However, with ongoing research and technological advancements, phage therapy is poised to become an integral component of modern medicine, offering hope in the fight against antibiotic-resistant infections and beyond [68]. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of phage-based drug development, exploring its applications in treating drug-resistant bacterial infections, biofilm-related conditions, intracellular pathogens, vaccine development, cancer therapy, and gene-delivery systems. Through detailed examination and discussion of these areas, we seek to highlight the potential and challenges of phage therapy in the contemporary medical landscape.

## 2. Updated Mechanisms of Phage Action

## 2.1. Phage Adsorption and Receptor Recognition Phage Adsorption and Receptor Recognition

The initial step in the phage life cycle is the adsorption to the bacterial surface, which is mediated by specific interactions between phage proteins and bacterial receptors. Recent studies have uncovered new receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) that enhance phage specificity and efficiency. For example, receptor-binding domains in phages have been shown to undergo rapid evolution, allowing them to adapt to bacterial surface variations [83]. Labrie et al. (2010) describe how bacteria have developed multiple defense mechanisms against phage adsorption, emphasizing the importance of understanding these interactions for phage therapy development [84]. This adaptability is crucial for developing phages that can target antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

This adaptability is crucial for developing phages that can target antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

## 2.2. Genome Injection and Host Takeover

Following adsorption, phages inject their genetic material into the bacterial cell. Advances in cryo-electron microscopy have elucidated the detailed structures of phage tail machinery involved in this process. Hu et al. (2013) revealed the architecture of the bacteriophage T7 DNA-injection machinery, providing insights into how phages overcome bacterial defenses during genome injection [85]. Additionally, some phages utilize sophisticated mechanisms to breach bacterial cell walls, such as enzymatic degradation of peptidoglycan layers [86]. These findings highlight potential targets for enhancing phage-delivery systems in therapeutic applications.

## 2.3. Replication Strategies

Phages display diverse replication strategies that are intricately linked to their lifecycle classification as lytic or lysogenic. The evolution of these replication strategies, along with the regulatory elements controlling the switch between lytic and lysogenic cycles, has been extensively discussed by Salmond and Fineran (2015) [87]. Additionally, phage-replication mechanisms are characterized by the modular arrangement of replication genes within their genomes, allowing for a systematic exploration of these strategies across various phages, including f1/fd, φ X174, P2, P4, λ , and T4. These studies have significantly advanced our understanding of DNA replication, particularly through the interplay between phageencoded and host-replication factors. The review by Weigel et al. (2006) also underscores the importance of replication origins and associated proteins, providing a valuable resource for further research [88].

## 2.4. Phage-Encoded Toxins and Enzymes

Phages often carry genes encoding toxins and enzymes that facilitate bacterial cell lysis and hijack host machinery. Penad é s and Christie (2015) identified new classes of phage-encoded proteins that interfere with bacterial metabolism and immune responses, providing a deeper understanding of phage-bacteria interactions [89]. Harper et al. (2014) describe phages that produce enzymes capable of degrading bacterial biofilms, enhancing their therapeutic potential against biofilm-associated infections [90].

## 2.5. Horizontal Gene Transfer and Phage Therapy

Phages play a critical role in horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which can spread antibiotic resistance genes among bacterial populations. Lerminiaux and Cameron (2019) detail the mechanisms by which phages contribute to HGT and the implications for antibiotic resistance [91]. However, engineered phages have been developed to minimize the risk of transferring harmful genes while maximizing therapeutic benefits. Usman et al. (2023) highlight the use of synthetic biology to design phages that selectively target and remove resistance genes from bacterial genomes [92].

## 2.6. Phage-Host Co-Evolution

The co-evolution of phages and their bacterial hosts is a dynamic process that influences phage efficacy. Modern high-throughput sequencing techniques have provided insights into the evolutionary arms race between phages and bacteria. Hampton et al. (2020) discuss how the continuous evolution of phages and bacteria impacts phage therapy effectiveness and the importance of understanding these dynamics [93]. Wright et al. (2018) emphasize the need for phage therapies that remain effective over time and do not lead to rapid bacterial resistance [94].

## 2.7. Immune System Interactions

Phage therapy's success depends not only on the interaction with bacterial cells but also on the host immune system. Hodyra-Stefaniak et al. (2015) demonstrated that phages can modulate the immune response, sometimes enhancing it to aid in bacterial

clearance [95]. Sweere et al. (2019) identified phage proteins that interact with immune cells, opening new avenues for designing phage-based immunotherapies [96].

## 2.8. Synthetic and Recombinant Phages

The advent of synthetic biology has enabled the creation of recombinant phages with enhanced properties. Kilcher et al. (2018) developed phages with synthetic gene circuits that have controlled lytic activity and improved host range, and they discussed its potential application against antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, as well as toward resistance to bacterial defense mechanisms [30]. Yosef et al. (2015) demonstrated the potential of temperate and lytic phages in developing phage-based treatments tailored to specific bacterial infections [48].

## 2.9. Phage Delivery Systems

Effective delivery of phages to the site of infection is critical for therapeutic success. Durr et al. (2023) describe updated delivery strategies, including encapsulation of phages in biocompatible materials such as liposomes and hydrogels to protect them from the host immune system and enhance their stability [97]. Malik et al. (2017) highlight advancements in delivery technologies that are crucial for developing phage-based drugs that can be administered in diverse clinical settings [98]. Inhalation of phages as a treatment for lung infections is an emerging area of research, offering a potential targeted treatment strategy. Shien et al. (2023) demonstrated that by directly delivering phages to the lungs via inhalation, the therapy can target the infection site more effectively, potentially reducing bacterial load and inflammation while preserving the natural microbiome. This method represents a novel and targeted strategy in the fight against respiratory infections [99].

## 2.10. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

The updated understanding of phage mechanisms also brings forth regulatory and ethical considerations for phage therapy. Abedon et al. (2011) discuss the importance of addressing safety, standardization, and public acceptance as phage-based treatments move closer to mainstream clinical use [6]. Pirnay et al. (2018) emphasize the need for ongoing research into phage mechanisms to inform regulatory frameworks and ensure the responsible development of phage-based drugs [100]. The mechanisms of phage action, from adsorption to lysis, highlight the precision and effectiveness of phages in targeting bacterial infections. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing phage therapy and overcoming the challenges posed by bacterial resistance.

In summary, recent advancements in molecular biology and genomics have deepened our understanding of bacteriophages (phages) and their mechanisms of action, which are crucial for phage-based drug development. Phages infect bacteria through a series of complex steps, beginning with adsorption to the bacterial surface, where receptorbinding proteins enhance specificity and efficiency. Following this, phages inject their genetic material into the bacterial cell, a process elucidated by cryo-electron microscopy. Their diverse replication strategies, which can switch between lytic and lysogenic cycles, have significant implications for therapeutic applications. Phages also encode toxins and enzymes that facilitate bacterial cell lysis and can degrade biofilms, enhancing their therapeutic potential. Additionally, phages play a critical role in horizontal gene transfer, which can spread antibiotic resistance genes, though engineered phages aim to mitigate this risk. Understanding these intricate mechanisms is vital for optimizing phage therapy and addressing bacterial resistance.

## 3. Phage Therapy for Drug-Resistant Bacterial Infections

The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to global public health, necessitating the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. Phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages to target and kill specific bacteria, has emerged as a promising solution to combat drug-resistant infections. This chapter explores the application of phage

therapy in treating drug-resistant bacterial infections, with a particular focus on the use of engineered phages to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

## 3.1. The Growing Threat of Antibiotic Resistance

Antibiotic resistance has become a critical issue in modern medicine, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), antibiotic-resistant bacteria are responsible for approximately 700,000 deaths annually worldwide, with projections reaching up to 10 million deaths per year by 2050 if no effective measures are taken [101]. The ability of bacteria to evolve and acquire resistance mechanisms has outpaced the development of new antibiotics, highlighting the urgent need for alternative treatments.

## 3.2. Mechanisms and Advantages of Phage Therapy

Phage therapy leverages bacteriophages to precisely target and lyse pathogenic bacteria, offering several distinct benefits compared to traditional antibiotics. Unlike broadspectrum antibiotics, phages are highly specific, targeting only the bacteria of interest and sparing beneficial microbiota. This specificity reduces the risk of secondary infections and mitigates the development of resistance [102]. Additionally, phages can self-amplify at the site of infection, providing a sustained therapeutic effect [103].

## 3.3. Targeting Specific Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Phages are highly specific to their bacterial hosts, which allows for targeted treatment of MDR bacteria without affecting the beneficial microbiota. This specificity is particularly valuable in treating infections caused by pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Clinical studies on the use of phages are currently being conducted worldwide, focusing primarily on drug-resistant bacterial infections (Table 2). Recently, a Belgian consortium of 35 hospitals across 29 cities and 12 countries reported the results of a clinical study involving 100 cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy [104]. In that study, clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2% and 61.3% of infections, respectively, demonstrating that phage therapy is effective against drug-resistant bacteria.

MRSA is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, notorious for its resistance to multiple antibiotics. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of phages in lysing MRSA strains both in vitro and in vivo. For instance, a study by Kebriaei et al. (2023) showed that a phage cocktail effectively reduced MRSA colonization in a mouse model of wound infection [105]. Currently, at least 14 clinical studies on phage therapy for Staphylococcus aureus infections have been completed or are ongoing (Table 2). Therefore, the development of phage therapy against MRSA/ Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most advanced and promising fields in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria.

In addition to Staphylococcus aureus infections, the development of phages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa ) infections is also in progress (Table 2). P. aeruginosa is inherently difficult to treat with antibiotics due to its natural resistance to many antimicrobial agents. While the development of anti-pseudomonal drugs has progressed, resistance to these drugs has also spread, leading to expectations for new treatments against P. aeruginosa infections. Currently, at least 14 clinical studies using phages for P. aeruginosa infections are either completed or ongoing. Among these, nine studies focus specifically on cystic fibrosis and respiratory tract infections.

* Note: The numbers in the table represent the number of research projects (clinical trials). In some cases, phage cocktails targeting different bacteria are included, with each counted as one project. Most of the research projects are currently ongoing, so many have not yet been published. The table was compiled by the authors using the ClinicalTrials.gov database from the National Library of Medicine (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, accessed on 15 August 2024), and there are no comprehensive references for the entire table. It provides an overview of the current status of clinical studies using bacteriophages.

VRE are responsible for severe infections in immunocompromised patients. Phages targeting VRE have shown promising results in preclinical studies. Some studies reported that specific phages could significantly reduce VRE colonization in a mouse gut model, highlighting their potential for treating gastrointestinal VRE infections [106-108]. For instance, research has demonstrated the efficacy of phages in controlling VRE in dental root canals and in reducing VRE biofilms [106,107]. Additionally, a study has shown the potential of phage vB\_EfKS5 for controlling Enterococcus faecalis in food systems [108]. The overall results support the potential of phage therapy as an effective approach for managing gastrointestinal VRE infections and associated diseases [109].

CRE pose a significant threat due to their resistance to last-resort antibiotics like carbapenems. Despite the potential of phage therapy for addressing CRE infections, there is a notable lack of well-defined and reported studies in this area. However, some research has demonstrated the promising potential of phage therapy for these infections. For example, while comprehensive studies are still limited, recent research by Chung et al. (2023) has demonstrated the potential of phage therapy for targeting CRE strains [110]. They also highlight the promising results of phage therapy in managing CRE infections, though further research is needed to fully establish its effectiveness.

## 3.4. Enhancing Therapeutic Potential by Engineered Phages

Advancements in genetic engineering have paved the way for the development of engineered phages with enhanced therapeutic properties. For instance, Yosef et al. (2015) demonstrated the potential of temperate and lytic conversions of bacteriophages for targeted bacterial eradication [48]. Similarly, Lu et al. (2007) engineered phages to express enzymes that degrade biofilms, addressing a major challenge in treating biofilm-associated infections [31]. These engineered phages provide tailored solutions for specific bacterial infections, thereby improving treatment outcomes. Additionally, Ando et al. (2015) showed that modifications to phage genomes can enhance targeting specificity, stability, and controlled release of therapeutic agents. Such advancements make engineered phages a potent tool for overcoming the limitations of traditional antibiotics, offering more precise and effective treatments for bacterial infections [34].

To better understand how these engineered approaches compare with conventional methods in addressing challenges in phage therapy, a comparative analysis is presented in Table 3. This table highlights the key differences between traditional phage therapy techniques and synthetic approaches, offering insights into the potential advantages of genetic engineering in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of phages.

Recent innovations in genetic engineering have opened new avenues for the application of CRISPR-Cas systems in phage therapy, providing a precise and efficient approach to target bacterial pathogens. For instance, Bikard et al. (2014) demonstrated the integra-

tion of CRISPR-Cas9 into bacteriophages, enabling the specific targeting and cleavage of bacterial DNA, leading to bacterial cell death [19]. Additionally, Kiga et al. (2020) and Shimamori et al. (2024) highlighted the use of CRISPR-Cas13a in bacteriophages to target and degrade bacterial RNA, effectively disrupting gene expression and inhibiting bacterial replication [17,128,129]. A recent study by Mitsunaka et al. (2022) presents a novel cell-free phage engineering and rebooting platform that enables the assembly of various phage genomes, including natural and synthetic ones, and the creation of biologically contained phages, which showed effectiveness similar to parent phages in treating lethal sepsis in vivo, thus advancing the practical application of phage therapy [132]. These advancements in engineered phages equipped with CRISPR-Cas systems represent a significant recent leap forward in combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, offering a highly specific and adaptable therapeutic strategy.

## 3.5. Phage Therapy in Combination with Antibiotics

Combining phage therapy with antibiotics has shown synergistic effects in treating drug-resistant infections. As summarized in Table 4, recent studies have provided substantial evidence supporting the efficacy of this combined approach. In a study by Racenis et al. (2023), the combination of phage therapy and antibiotics was used to treat a patient with a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection. The synergistic effect of the combined treatment led to a significant reduction in bacterial load and improved clinical outcomes [133]. This study highlighted the potential of phage-antibiotic combinations to overcome bacterial resistance and enhance treatment efficacy. Additionally, an interesting study by Fujiki et al. (2024) demonstrated that phages can drive selection toward restoring antibiotic sensitivity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa via chromosomal deletions. The insights gained from the trade-offs between phage and antibiotic sensitivity could help maximize the potential of phage therapy for treating infectious diseases [134].

Another recent study by Kebriaei et al. (2023) investigated the efficacy of phageantibiotic combinations in treating biofilm-associated infections caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The researchers found that the combination therapy

was more effective in disrupting biofilms and killing bacteria compared to either treatment alone [105]. This finding is particularly important due to the difficulty in treating biofilmassociated infections with antibiotics alone.

A 2022 study by Gordillo Altamirano et al. (2022) evaluated the in vivo effects of a phage-antibiotic combination on Acinetobacter baumannii using phage øFG02. In a murine model, the combination therapy significantly reduced bacterial burden compared to PBS and ceftazidime alone. Over time, this combination outperformed phage-only treatment, and phage-resistant bacteria became resensitized to ceftazidime. These findings highlight the potential of phage-antibiotic combination therapy in restoring antibiotic efficacy against Acinetobacter baumannii [135].

In a 2021 case report by Cano et al. (2021), a combination of phage therapy and antibiotics was used to treat a patient with a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection. The treatment led to rapid clinical improvement and clearance of the infection, demonstrating the potential of phage-antibiotic combinations in treating severe resistant infections [136].

In the study by Petrovic Fabijan et al. (2020), bacteriophage therapy was evaluated for safety in treating severe Staphylococcus aureus infections, demonstrating promising results in terms of clinical tolerance and bacterial reduction when combined with antibiotics [137]. Similarly, Jault et al. (2019) assessed the efficacy of a phage cocktail in a randomized trial for Pseudomonas aeruginosa burn wound infections, finding that phage therapy, when combined with antibiotics, was both effective and well-tolerated. These studies support the potential of phage-antibiotic combination therapy as a complementary approach for managing resistant bacterial infections [138]. Additionally, a review by Osman et al. (2023) discussed the potential of phage-antibiotic combination therapy in enhancing bacterial clearance and improving clinical outcomes, particularly in chronic infections such as those associated with diabetic foot ulcers [139].

These recent studies and clinical trials highlight the growing evidence supporting the use of phage therapy in combination with antibiotics. The synergistic effects observed in these cases underscore the potential of this approach to enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotics, reduce the likelihood of resistance development, and improve clinical outcomes in patients with drug-resistant bacterial infections.

## 3.6. Regulatory and Safety Considerations

The development and application of phage therapy must adhere to stringent regulatory and safety standards. Phage preparations must undergo rigorous testing to ensure their safety, purity, and efficacy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have established guidelines for the clinical use of phage therapy, emphasizing the need for well-designed clinical trials and comprehensive safety assessments [68,140]. Additionally, ethical considerations, such as informed consent and patient education, are crucial in the implementation of phage therapy [100].

In conclusion, this chapter underscores the urgent need for innovative approaches like phage therapy in the fight against drug-resistant bacterial infections. With antibiotic resistance posing a severe global health threat, phage therapy offers a targeted and effective alternative. The specificity of phages, their ability to be genetically engineered for enhanced efficacy, and their potential when combined with antibiotics highlight their promise in addressing this growing crisis. As research advances, careful consideration of regulatory and safety standards will be essential to realize the full potential of phage therapy in clinical settings.

## 4.1. Mechanisms of Phage Action Against Biofilms

In recent years, the study of bacteriophages has revealed their remarkable potential in combating biofilms, which are structured communities of bacteria encased in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. These biofilms pose significant challenges in clinical and industrial settings due to their resistance to conventional treatments. This document explores the various mechanisms by which phages enhance their effectiveness against biofilms, highlighting the ability of phages to penetrate the EPS matrix, target quiescent cells, and induce biofilm dispersal. Through these mechanisms, phages offer a promising

alternative or complement to traditional antimicrobial strategies. Phages exhibit several mechanisms that enhance their effectiveness against biofilms.

Penetration of EPS matrix: Phages can produce enzymes such as depolymerases that degrade components of the EPS matrix, facilitating their penetration and disruption of the biofilm structure. Ribeiro et al. (2023) demonstrated that phage cocktails could efficiently target biofilm-forming Salmonella serovars by utilizing such enzymes to disrupt biofilm integrity [149]. Similarly, Zuo et al. (2022) highlight an innovative approach to using bacteriophages in biofouling mitigation through a biofilm-responsive encapsulated phage coating. This study reveals that the coating comprises a biocompatible polymer matrix that encapsulates the phages. The matrix is engineered to be responsive to specific biofilm-associated enzymes, which trigger the release of phages when biofilm formation is detected. This autonomous response leads to the targeted disruption of the biofilm matrix by the released phages. Additionally, this approach holds promise for influencing innate immune responses, as the released phages could interact with the host's immune system and potentially modulate immune-signaling pathways. This adds a new dimension to the therapeutic applications of phages, particularly in scenarios where biofilm-associated infections pose a challenge [151].

Targeting quiescent cells: Unlike antibiotics, which often fail to affect dormant or slow-growing cells within biofilms, phages have shown the ability to infect and kill these cells once they resume metabolic activity. This capability ensures more comprehensive biofilm eradication. For example, Melo et al. (2019) assessed the efficacy of enterococci phages in an in vitro biofilm wound model and found that phages could target and disrupt both active and dormant bacterial cells within biofilms [145].

Biofilm dispersal: Some phages can induce biofilm dispersal by triggering bacterial cells to produce enzymes like dispersin B, which promotes the detachment of bacteria from the biofilm matrix. Olszak et al. (2019) observed that a specific Jumbo phage could significantly impact both planktonic and biofilm populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , leading to reduced biofilm formation and increased susceptibility to further treatments [146]. Furthermore, Guti é rrez et al. (2015) explored the anti-biofilm properties of the pre-neck appendage protein Dpo7 from phage vB\_SepiS-phiIPLA7 in staphylococcal species. Their findings reveal that Dpo7 can effectively disrupt established biofilms and inhibit their formation. The ability of Dpo7 to target and degrade biofilm structures suggests a potential role in modulating the host's innate immune response, particularly in biofilm-associated infections where the immune system struggles to clear biofilm-embedded bacteria. By facilitating the breakdown of biofilms, Dpo7 may enhance the accessibility of immune cells to bacterial cells, potentially influencing innate immune-signaling pathways and improving the overall efficacy of phage therapy against staphylococcal infections [150].

## 4.2. Advantages of Phage-Based Biofilm Treatments

Phage-based treatments have garnered significant attention as a promising solution for biofilm-related infections, offering several distinct advantages over traditional antimicrobial approaches. This section outlines the key benefits of phage therapy, emphasizing its specificity, self-replicating nature, and synergistic potential when combined with other antimicrobial agents. By leveraging these unique properties, phage therapy presents a targeted, sustained, and effective approach to addressing biofilm-associated infections, potentially transforming the landscape of bacterial infection management. Phage-based treatments offer several distinct advantages for addressing biofilm-related infections.

Specificity: Phages exhibit a high level of specificity, targeting particular bacterial species or strains without affecting beneficial microbiota. This specificity helps to minimize dysbiosis, a common side effect associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. According to Pires et al. (2022), the precise targeting of phages reduces collateral damage and preserves the balance of the host's microbiota, making phage therapy a more selective and potentially safer alternative to traditional antibiotics [153].

Self-replication: One of the key benefits of phage therapy is its auto-dosing capability. Phages replicate at the site of infection as long as there are susceptible bacteria present, providing sustained antibacterial activity. This self-replicating property decreases the need for frequent administration and ensures a prolonged therapeutic effect. Wang et al. (2024) highlight this advantage, noting that phages can continuously target and destroy bacteria within biofilms, which is particularly useful for chronic infections [154].

Synergistic effects: Phages can be combined with antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents to enhance overall treatment efficacy. This synergistic approach can help overcome bacterial resistance and reduce the likelihood of resistance development. Fedorov et al. (2023) discuss the successful application of phage-antibiotic combinations in treating periprosthetic infections, demonstrating how combining these treatments can improve outcomes and combat resistant bacterial strains [141]. Similarly, Ghanaim et al. (2023) emphasize the potential of phage therapy as a complementary strategy to antibiotics, especially for multidrug-resistant infections [142]. Abdelhamid and Yousef (2023) further review emerging strategies for combining phages with other antibiofilm agents, highlighting the potential for synergistic effects in managing persistent infections [143].

## 4.3. Case Studies and Applications

Phage therapy has demonstrated significant promise in managing various biofilmrelated infections. Here are some illustrative case studies and applications.

Chronic wound infections: Chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers and pressure sores, often present biofilms that hinder healing. Phage therapy has shown promise in disrupting these biofilms and promoting wound healing [155]. Verbanic et al. (2022) highlighted the role of phages in chronic wound infections, emphasizing their effectiveness in targeting biofilm-forming bacteria and improving healing outcomes [156]. Additionally, Akturk et al. (2023) demonstrated that combining phages with antibiotics could enhance antibiofilm efficacy in an in vitro model, showing improved bacterial reduction and wound healing [144].

Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections: CF patients frequently suffer from chronic lung infections caused by biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Conventional antibiotics often fail to eradicate these biofilms, leading to persistent infections and declining lung function. Fiscarelli et al. (2021) provided evidence of the effectiveness of phage therapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in cystic fibrosis patients, demonstrating significant biofilm disruption and bacterial killing [157]. Furthermore, Tan et al. (2021) reported successful personalized phage therapy for a carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii lung infection in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, illustrating the potential for tailored phage therapies in severe infections [158].

Medical device-associated infections: Biofilms on medical devices, such as catheters, prosthetic joints, and heart valves, pose significant risks due to their resistance to standard treatments. Phage therapy has been investigated as a method to prevent and treat these infections. For instance, Mirzaei et al. (2022) demonstrated that a phage cocktail could effectively control surface colonization by Proteus mirabilis in catheter-associated urinary tract infections, suggesting its potential for preventing device-related infections [159].

Dental plaque and periodontal disease: Dental biofilms, or plaque, are major contributors to dental caries and periodontal disease. Phage therapy has been explored as an alternative or adjunct to traditional plaque control methods. Kowalski et al. (2022) discussed the potential benefits of using bacteriophages in periodontal therapy, suggesting they could be an effective strategy for managing periodontal disease [160]. Chen et al. (2021) also highlighted the feasibility of phage therapy for periodontitis, showing that phages targeting dental biofilms could significantly reduce biofilm formation and improve oral hygiene [161].

## 4.4. Challenges and Future Directions

As phage therapy continues to emerge as a promising alternative for treating biofilmassociated infections, it is essential to critically address the obstacles that must be overcome to fully realize its potential. The following section explores the key challenges and future directions in the field, focusing on regulatory hurdles, phage resistance, and delivery mechanisms. By examining these issues, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and highlight the necessary steps for advancing phage therapy from experimental applications to widespread clinical use.

Regulatory approval: Ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of phage preparations is crucial for gaining regulatory approval. Cooper et al. (2016) emphasize the need for standardized protocols and rigorous clinical trials to establish phage therapy as a viable therapeutic option [162]. Additionally, Pirnay et al. (2018) discuss the complexities of navigating regulatory pathways for phage-based therapeutics, underscoring the importance of developing clear guidelines [100].

Phage Resistance: Just as with antibiotics, bacteria can develop resistance to phages, which poses a significant challenge. Borin et al. (2021) highlight the importance of coevolutionary phage training to enhance bacterial suppression and delay the emergence of phage resistance [163]. This approach necessitates the continual discovery and development of new phages to stay ahead of bacterial adaptations. Recently, Kaneko et al. (2023) demonstrated that using a combination of bacteriophages with different physiological characteristics in a cocktail is crucial for effectively and continuously lysing bacteria, such as Escherichia coli , over a prolonged period while also suppressing the emergence of phageresistant bacterial strains. This method shows promise as a strategy to enhance the efficacy of phage therapy [164].

Phage delivery: Effective delivery of phages to the biofilm site is critical for successful treatment. Kim et al. (2021) review advances in phage-delivering hydrogels, which can enhance phage stability and activity within biofilm environments, improving treatment outcomes [152]. Additionally, Malik et al. (2017) explore various formulation, stabilization, and encapsulation techniques for bacteriophages, which are essential for optimizing their delivery and efficacy [98].

In conclusion, while phage therapy offers a targeted approach to combating biofilmassociated infections, addressing these challenges will be key to realizing its full potential. By overcoming regulatory, resistance, and delivery issues, researchers and clinicians can further develop phage-based treatments to enhance patient outcomes and address the limitations of conventional antimicrobial strategies.

## 5. Phage Therapy for Intracellular Bacteria

Intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Salmonella spp., and Chlamydia trachomatis , reside within host cells, making them challenging to target with conventional antibiotics. Phage therapy offers a promising approach to combatting these infections by exploiting the ability of bacteriophages to infect and replicate within host cells. This section explores the application of phage therapy for intracellular bacterial infections, including the mechanisms of action, advantages, and case studies demonstrating efficacy.

## 5.1. Mechanisms of Phage Action Against Intracellular Bacteria

In recent years, the therapeutic potential of bacteriophages, or phages, in combating bacterial infections has garnered significant attention. Phages have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in targeting and eliminating bacteria, even those residing within host cells. The following text delves into the mechanisms through which phages can target intracellular bacteria, highlighting their ability to penetrate host cells, induce bacterial lysis, and modulate host immune responses. By exploring these mechanisms, we gain insight into the promising role of phage therapy in treating intracellular bacterial infections. Phages can target intracellular bacteria through several mechanisms:

Intracellular penetration: Certain phages possess the ability to penetrate host cells and deliver their genetic material into the intracellular compartment, where they can replicate and produce progeny phages. This allows phages to target bacteria residing within host cells, such as macrophages or epithelial cells. For instance, Schmalstig et al. (2024) demonstrated that bacteriophages could infect and kill intracellular Mycobacterium abscessus within macrophages [165]. Similarly, Yang et al. (2024) reported the successful use of bacteriophage therapy in humanized mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis [166].

Lysis of intracellular bacteria: Once inside the host cell, phages can induce the lysis of intracellular bacteria, leading to the release of phage progeny and the subsequent infection of neighboring bacterial cells. This process effectively reduces the intracellular bacterial load and promotes the clearance of infection. Johansen et al. (2021) illustrated that phageantibiotic therapy could significantly enhance the clearance of drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus by promoting bacterial lysis [167].

Modulation of host immune response: Phages can modulate host immune responses to enhance bacterial clearance. For example, they can stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines or activate immune cells, such as macrophages, to facilitate bacterial killing. This immunomodulatory effect was noted by Dedrick et al. (2017), where bacteriophage therapy stimulated immune responses to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections [168].

## 5.2. Advantages of Phage Therapy for Intracellular Bacterial Infections

The use of bacteriophages in treating bacterial infections has expanded beyond traditional applications to include targeting intracellular pathogens. This advancement is crucial in addressing infections that are otherwise difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics. The following text explores the specific mechanisms through which phages can effectively target intracellular bacteria, such as their ability to deliver genetic material directly into infected cells, their persistence within these cells to maintain antibacterial activity, and their synergistic interactions with host immune responses. These mechanisms underscore the potential of phage therapy in providing a targeted, effective approach to combating intracellular bacterial infections.

Targeted intracellular delivery: Phages can specifically target intracellular bacteria while sparing host cells, minimizing off-target effects, and reducing the risk of host cell damage. Shield et al. (2021) highlighted the specificity of bacteriophages in targeting mycobacterial infections without harming the host cells [169].

Intracellular persistence: Phages can replicate within host cells, ensuring sustained antibacterial activity at the site of infection and overcoming the limitations of conventional antibiotics, which may have limited intracellular penetration or activity. Dedrick et al. (2022) showed that phages could persist and replicate within infected cells, maintaining antibacterial efficacy [170].

Synergy with host immune responses: Phages can synergize with host immune responses to enhance bacterial clearance, potentially overcoming immune-evasion mechanisms employed by intracellular bacteria. This synergy was demonstrated early by Broxmeyer et al. (2002), where phage therapy enhanced the host's immune response to clear intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis [171].

## 5.3. Case Studies and Applications

The application of phage therapy in treating intracellular bacterial infections offers a novel and promising approach to combating pathogens that reside within host cells. Traditional antibiotics often struggle with limited intracellular penetration and activity, making phage therapy an attractive alternative. The following case studies and applications highlight the potential of phage therapy in targeting intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Salmonella spp., and Chlamydia trachomatis , demonstrating significant reductions in bacterial load and enhanced treatment efficacy.

Tuberculosis (TB): Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causative agent of TB, primarily infects macrophages, where it can persist and evade host immune responses. Phage therapy has shown promise in targeting intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis . A study by Schmalstig et al. (2024) demonstrated that mycobacteriophage could infect and replicate within Mycobacterium tuberculosis -infected macrophages, leading to a significant reduction in intracellular bacterial load [165].

Salmonella spp.: Salmonella infections are associated with a range of clinical manifestations, including gastroenteritis, typhoid fever, and systemic infections. The rise of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains has spurred interest in alternative treatment strategies, such as phage therapy. Recent studies have shown that bacteriophages can effectively target intracellular Salmonella , a challenging infection site for conventional antibiotics due to the bacteria's ability to reside within host cells. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that specific phages can significantly reduce the intracellular Salmonella load, suggesting their potential as adjunctive therapies to enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotics and reduce the development of resistance [172,173]. Additionally, animal models have confirmed the ability of phages to penetrate and disrupt Salmonella within infected tissues, offering hope for treating persistent infections where traditional antibiotics may fall short [112]. This approach could be particularly valuable in cases of multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains where treatment options are increasingly limited [174]. Furthermore, combining phage therapy with antibiotics has shown synergistic effects, potentially lowering the required antibiotic dose and minimizing side effects [175].

Chlamydia trachomatis: Chlamydia trachomatis is a small, Gram-negative obligate intracellular pathogen that causes sexually transmitted infections and trachoma in humans. Due to the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance, phage therapy has emerged as a promising alternative for targeting such intracellular pathogens. Notably, a study has shown that with rising antibiotic-resistant Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections, the chlamydia-specific lytic phage Φ CPG1 has emerged as a promising treatment. Φ CPG1 has demonstrated broad inhibitory effects on all CT serotypes, effectively disrupting infection stages and inhibiting bacterial growth [176]. This phage's ability to target CT highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic agent. Additionally, the engineered pGFPΦ CPG1 phage offers a valuable tool for future research on CT drug resistance and vaccine development [176]. This finding aligns with ongoing research into chlamydiaphages, a group of bacteriophages known to infect various Chlamydia species, highlighting their potential as a novel therapeutic strategy in combating infections caused by these dangerous microbes [177].

## 5.4. Challenges and Future Directions

By integrating antigenic peptides into phage structures, these vaccines can enhance immune responses and provide broad protection against various pathogens. The innovative design and versatile applications of phage-based vaccines underscore their potential to revolutionize vaccine development and address a wide range of infectious diseases. Figure 3 illustrates the overall mechanism of immune response induction by phage-based vaccines.

( A ) Mechanism of self-adjuvanting effect of phages and how phage prime innate immune response: Wide variety of Figure 3. A ) Mechanism of self-adjuvanting effect of phages and how phage prime innate immune response: Wide variety of phages, filamentous, tailed, or icosahedral were utilized as vaccine vectors. The intrinsic components of the phages such as the repetitive ordered capsid proteins, DNA, RNA, and CpG Islands can act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and can bind either cell-surface or endosomal Tolllike receptors (TLRs) such as TLR 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. These receptors are pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that are primarily seen in innate immune cells and functions in pathogen identification. The viral structural proteins are known to bind TLR2 and TLR4, whereas the DNA, RNA, and CpG Islands bind TLR3, TLR7 and 8, and TLR 9, respectively [181,182]. In addition to phage components, impurities derived from lysates can also induce an immune response, ex. LPS. The PAMPs' postbinding of respective TLRs can activate Myd88 pathway and downstream signalling, leading to phosphorylation of IKK complex, IKKα , IKKβ , and NEMO subunits. The IKK complex when phosphorylated frees NFκ B enables nuclear translocation that furthers the expression of array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons imparting adjuvant-like effect [182]. ( B ) Construction of peptide vaccine and DNA vaccine using phages: Peptide vaccines were prepared by inserting antigenic epitopes as fusion tags to the structural proteins of the capsids. This technique enables the display of the antigens on the surface that could mediate an antigen-specific immune response.

In case of DNA vaccine, the phage genome is inserted with an antigen-encoding gene cassette. In this way, the DNA of the antigen is encapsulated in phage head and is delivered to the target immune cells wherein the DNA is transcribed and translated to express antigen of interest [183]. ( C ) Mechanism of phage vaccine imparting antigen-specific response: The peptide epitope (from peptide vaccine) or the antigens expressed (from DNA vaccine) can impart an antigen-specific immune response. The phage vaccines taken up by APCs were processed and the antigens were presented to naive T-cells via MHC II or MHC I. This process of the presentation activates the naïve T-cells to become CTLs or Th cells. The activated Th cells further boost the memory CTL production and also impart a boost towards antigen-specific antibody production via humoral B-cell responses. The adaptive immune response is known to be further boosted by the self-adjuvanting activity of the phages itself via production of wide array of pro-inflammatory cytokines [184].

## 6.1. Principles of Phage-Based Vaccine Design

Phage-based vaccines utilize bacteriophages as carriers to deliver immunogenic epitopes, capitalizing on their ability to present antigenic peptides or proteins to the immune system effectively. This section outlines the core principles of phage-based vaccine design, including the role of phage-display systems in presenting antigens, the advantages of multivalent vaccines in targeting diverse pathogens, and the intrinsic adjuvant properties of phages that enhance immune responses. By integrating these principles, phage-based vaccines offer innovative and versatile solutions for developing effective vaccines against various infectious diseases.

Display Systems: Phage-display systems, including filamentous phages such as M13 and T7 phages, are instrumental in presenting foreign antigens on the phage surface. Antigenic peptides or proteins are genetically fused to phage coat proteins, which are then expressed and displayed during phage replication. This method has been extensively reviewed by Gonz á lez-Mora et al. (2020) and Mohammad Hasani et al. (2023), highlighting its efficacy in antigen delivery [11,185].

Multivalent Vaccines: Phage-based vaccines can present multiple antigenic epitopes simultaneously, thereby enhancing the breadth and specificity of the immune response. Such multivalent vaccines can target diverse strains or variants of a pathogen, offering broader protection. For instance, Bao et al. (2019) emphasize the versatility of multivalent phage-based vaccines in providing extensive coverage against antigenically diverse pathogens [186]. Similarly, the application of this approach in vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 has been explored by Zhu et al. (2022) and Tao et al. (2018) [187,188].

Adjuvant Properties: Phages exhibit intrinsic adjuvant properties, capable of stimulating innate immune responses. They can activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), thereby enhancing antigen presentation and cytokine production. This adjuvant activity is crucial for the effectiveness of phage-based vaccines. Studies by Jepson and March (2004) and G ó rski et al. (2012) underscore the potential of phages to act as adjuvants in vaccine formulations [189,190]. The recent work by Krut and Bekeredjian-Ding (2018) further explores how phage therapy can modulate immune responses [191].

Phage-based vaccines are not only innovative in their design but also versatile in their applications. Their ability to present multiple antigens, coupled with their adjuvant properties, makes them a valuable tool in the development of vaccines against a wide range of infectious diseases.

## 6.2. Mechanisms of Immune Stimulation

Phage-based vaccines are emerging as promising tools in immunotherapy due to their ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses through diverse mechanisms. This section explores these mechanisms, highlighting the interactions between phages and the immune system that led to effective immunity. Specifically, it examines how phages activate innate immune responses, facilitate antigen presentation, and stimulate both T cell and B cell activation. The intricate processes involved and the potential of

phage-based vaccines in advancing vaccine development are underscored by key studies in the field.

Innate Immune Activation: Phages initiate innate immune responses by interacting with pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This interaction triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and Type I interferons, which enhance antigen presentation and immune cell recruitment. The intricate mechanisms of this activation are detailed by Van Belleghem et al. (2018) and Popescu et al. (2021), who highlight the role of phages in modulating the innate immune system [192,193]. Carroll-Portillo and Lin (2019) provide crucial insights into how bacteriophages can influence the innate immune-signaling pathway. Their study reveals that phages are capable of interacting with immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and they can modulate key signaling pathways, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. This interaction can lead to either the activation or suppression of innate immune responses, depending on the context. The ability of phages to modulate these pathways suggests that they may play a role in shaping the host's immune environment, with potential implications for both therapeutic applications and the understanding of host-pathogen dynamics [181].

Antigen Presentation: Phage-based vaccines effectively deliver antigenic epitopes to APCs such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. These cells process and present the antigens to T cells, initiating the adaptive immune response. This process leads to the activation and differentiation of antigen-specific T cells and B cells. The efficacy of this antigen delivery and presentation is demonstrated by the work of Sartorius et al. (2015), who showed that filamentous bacteriophages can trigger robust immune responses through TLR9-mediated pathways [194]. Xu et al. (2022) also emphasize the utility of phage-display systems in targeting specific immune cells [195].

T Cell Activation: Phage-presented antigens are crucial for the activation of antigenspecific T cells. This activation results in the proliferation and differentiation of effector T cells. CD4+ T cells assist B cells in antibody production, while CD8+ T cells are instrumental in mediating cellular immunity by eliminating infected cells. The role of phage-based vaccines in T cell activation is explored by Chatterjee and Duerkop (2018), who discuss emerging paradigms in phage-eukaryotic host interactions [196].

B Cell Activation: Phage-based vaccines stimulate B cell activation and antibody production against the presented antigens. Activated B cells undergo clonal expansion and differentiate into plasma cells, which produce antigen-specific antibodies. These antibodies neutralize pathogens and facilitate their clearance from the body. Research by Eriksson et al. (2009) illustrates how phages can induce immune responses that lead to effective pathogen neutralization [197]. Additionally, Ragothaman and Yoo (2023) review advances in engineered phage-based vaccines, including their impact on B cell activation [198].

The multifaceted mechanisms by which phage-based vaccines stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses underscore their potential as powerful tools in vaccine development and immunotherapy.

7.1. Mechanisms of Phage-Mediated Anti-Cancer Activity

Phages have emerged as promising anti-cancer agents due to their ability to target and kill cancer cells through various mechanisms. This section explores the diverse ways in

which phages exert their anti-cancer effects, including their capacity for tumor targeting, direct cytotoxicity, and indirect modulation of the tumor microenvironment. By engineering phages to specifically bind to tumor cells, induce cell death, and stimulate immune responses, researchers are advancing novel cancer therapies that leverage the unique properties of phages. Key studies highlight the potential of phage technology in enhancing cancer detection and treatment, showcasing its versatility and efficacy in oncology.

Tumor Targeting: Phages can be engineered to specifically target tumor cells by displaying tumor-specific ligands or peptides on their surfaces. This targeting capability is facilitated through ligands that bind to receptors overexpressed on cancer cells, promoting selective phage internalization and subsequent tumor cell destruction [225]. For instance, Veeranarayanan et al. (2021) highlight the advancement of phage technology in targeting solid tumors by conjugating phages with molecules that recognize tumor-associated antigens, enhancing the specificity and efficacy of treatment [13].

Direct Tumor Cell Killing: Upon attachment to tumor cells, phages can induce direct cytotoxic effects through several mechanisms. These include the release of phage-encoded cytotoxic proteins or enzymes, activation of apoptotic pathways, and disruption of essential cellular processes [226]. Przystal et al. (2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of systemic temozolomide-activated phage-targeted gene therapy in human glioblastoma, illustrating how phages can be engineered to deliver therapeutic genes directly to tumor cells, leading to their destruction [209].

Indirect Anti-Tumor Effects: Beyond direct cytotoxicity, phages can exert indirect anti-tumor effects by modulating the tumor microenvironment and stimulating immune responses against cancer cells. They can activate immune cells, such as dendritic cells and T cells, thereby enhancing the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by the immune system [227]. For example, Fredrik Eriksson et al. (2009) demonstrated that tumor-specific bacteriophages could induce tumor destruction through the activation of tumor-associated macrophages, highlighting the potential of phages to orchestrate an immune-mediated attack on tumors [197].

Additionally, the development of modified bacteriophages for tumor detection and targeted therapy has been explored. Shen et al. (2023) reported on the use of engineered phages for enhanced tumor detection and targeted treatment, showcasing advances in phage technology that improve the precision and efficacy of cancer therapy [14]. Similarly, Dong et al. (2020) discussed the use of bioinorganic hybrid bacteriophages to modulate the intestinal microbiota and remodel the tumor-immune microenvironment against colorectal cancer, emphasizing the versatility of phage-based approaches in cancer treatment [28].

## 7.2. Development of Phage-Based Cancer Therapies

Phage-based cancer therapies are advancing the frontiers of cancer treatment by harnessing the unique capabilities of phages. This section reviews innovative strategies in this field, including targeted drug delivery, gene therapy, and immunotherapy. Phages offer a versatile platform for precisely delivering therapeutic agents to tumor cells, encoding therapeutic genes for direct cancer cell targeting, and stimulating anti-tumor immune responses. Key developments in these areas highlight the potential of phage-based approaches to improve the specificity, efficacy, and versatility of cancer treatments. The advancements in targeted delivery systems, gene therapies, and immune modulation underscore the promising future of phage technology in oncology.

Targeted Drug Delivery: Phages offer a promising approach for targeted drug delivery to tumor cells, enhancing the efficacy and specificity of anti-cancer treatments. Drugs or therapeutic agents can be conjugated to phage surfaces or encapsulated within phage capsids, allowing for precise delivery to tumor sites [228]. For example, Kumar et al. (2023) describe the use of phages as vehicles for delivering therapeutic agents, improving the targeted delivery of drugs to cancerous tissues [229]. Similarly, Wang et al. (2024) review various phage-based delivery systems, highlighting their applications and challenges in nanomedicines for targeted cancer therapy [16].

Gene Therapy: Phages can be engineered to deliver therapeutic genes directly to tumor cells, presenting a novel approach for cancer gene therapy. Phage genomes can be modified to incorporate gene expression cassettes that encode anti-cancer proteins, immunomodulatory factors, or suicide genes, facilitating targeted gene delivery to tumor cells [210]. Sittiju et al. (2024) have developed bacteriophage-based particles carrying the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) gene for targeted delivery in hepatocellular carcinoma, demonstrating the potential of phages in gene therapy [211]. Furthermore, AlBahrani et al. (2023) utilized a transmorphic phage-guided systemic delivery of the TNF α gene for treating pediatric medulloblastoma, showcasing the versatility of phage-mediated gene therapy [212].

Immunotherapy: Phages can also function as immunotherapeutic agents to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. Phage-display libraries can be used to identify tumorspecific antigens or epitopes, which can then be used to generate phage-based vaccines or immunomodulatory agents for cancer immunotherapy [213]. For example, Hajitou (2010) discusses the role of targeted systemic gene therapy and molecular imaging in cancer, highlighting the potential of phage vectors for enhancing immune responses against tumors [230]. Moreover, Dong et al. (2023) explored a self-adjuvanting phage-enabled hydrogel for remodeling the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating the potential of phages in immune modulation and cancer therapy [214].

## 7.3. Applications of Phage-Based Cancer Therapies

Phage-based cancer therapies are emerging as a transformative approach with a range of applications in cancer treatment. This section explores their potential across different cancer types, including solid tumors, hematological malignancies, and combination therapies. Engineered phages have demonstrated efficacy in targeting and treating solid tumors, enhancing the effectiveness of treatments for cancers such as breast, lung, and colon. In hematological malignancies, phages offer novel strategies for gene delivery and immunomodulation. Additionally, integrating phage-based therapies with conventional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation could improve overall outcomes by enhancing tumor cell destruction and reducing resistance. Advances in these areas underscore the significant promise of phage technology in advancing cancer treatment strategies

Solid Tumors: Phage-based therapies have been explored for treating solid tumors such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. Engineered phages displaying tumortargeting ligands or cytotoxic payloads have shown efficacy in preclinical models of these solid tumors [231]. For instance, Turrini et al. (2024) engineered a spheroid-penetrating phage nanovector for the photodynamic treatment of colon cancer cells, illustrating the application of phage-based systems in solid tumor therapy [232].

Hematological Malignancies: Research is also ongoing into phage-based therapies for hematological malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma. Phage-mediated gene delivery and immunomodulation strategies have the potential to enhance the efficacy of existing therapies and address issues of drug resistance [212]. Zheng et al. (2019) demonstrated that phage-guided modulation of the gut microbiota can augment responses to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer models, highlighting a novel application of phage therapy in hematological malignancies [215]. Additionally, phage therapy shows promise in addressing complications like acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Gut dysbiosis, particularly the overgrowth of Enterococcus faecalis, is a known risk factor for aGVHD. Recent research by Fujimoto et al. (2024) has identified a phage-derived enzyme targeting E. faecalis biofilms, which are resistant to conventional antibiotics. In aGVHD-induced mice, this enzyme reduced E. faecalis levels and improved survival, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for protecting against aGVHD and improving outcomes in hematological malignancies [233].

Combination Therapies: Integrating phage-based therapies with conventional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors holds significant potential to enhance overall treatment outcomes. Such combinations may lead

to improved tumor cell eradication, reduced treatment resistance, and minimized adverse effects [234]. For instance, the photothermal phage developed by Shahri-Varkevishahi et al. (2021) demonstrates the utility of virus-based agents in photothermal therapy, which can be further combined with other treatment modalities for heightened efficacy [235]. Moreover, phage application in modulating gut microbiota, particularly by targeting colorectal cancerassociated bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), offers promising therapeutic potential [236]. These emerging strategies underscore the multifaceted role of phages in expanding the therapeutic arsenal against cancer.

## 7.4. Challenges and Future Directions

Despite their promising potential, phage-based cancer therapies face several challenges that must be addressed to fully realize their benefits. This section examines key issues, including enhancing the specificity and efficiency of tumor targeting, managing immune responses to avoid adverse effects, and navigating the transition from preclinical research to clinical trials. Improving targeting mechanisms, understanding and modulating immune interactions, and ensuring rigorous safety and efficacy evaluations are essential for advancing phage-based therapies. Addressing these challenges through ongoing research and development will be crucial for optimizing the application of phage technology in cancer treatment.
