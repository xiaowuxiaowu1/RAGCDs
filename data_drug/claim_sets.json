Engineered phages displaying tumortargeting ligands or cytotoxic payloads have shown efficacy in preclinical models of these solid tumors [231]. For instance, Turrini et al.

Ryan , $^{1,2,}$* Ishan Mehta, 3 Narod Kebabci, 1,4 and David J. Adams 3\n\nSynthetic lethal interactions, where mutation of one gene renders cells sensitive to inhibition of another gene, can be exploited for the development of targeted therapeutics in cancer. Pairs of duplicate genes (paralogs) often share common functionality and hence are a potentially rich source of synthetic lethal interactions. Because the majority of human genes have paralogs, exploiting such interactions could be a widely applicable approach for targeting gene loss in cancer. Moreover, existing small-molecule drugs may exploit synthetic lethal interactions by inhibiting multiple paralogs simultaneously.",

AI enhances radiologists' abilities by adding a second layer of analysis and increasing the precision of cancer diagnosis on anything from mammograms to CT images [17].\n\nEarly Identification and Avoidance: A key element in enhancing cancer outcomes is early detection. AI helps diagnose cancer early by evaluating imaging data and finding patterns linked to the early phases of the disease's development. When treatment choices are more effective and less intrusive, healthcare practitioners can intervene earlier thanks to this proactive approach [18].

There are many factors underpinning this growing need including the high degree of complexity of this disease, the ability for transformed cells to develop resistance to cancer chemotherapeutics, and the time and costs associated with bringing a new agent to the clinic.

The latter received a lot of attention through BioNTech's and Moderna's focus on developing mRNA-based COVID-19 and tumor vaccines [126,127]. Their cancer vaccine approach harnesses mRNA transcripts encoding up to 20 neoantigens, which are delivered using mRNA-lipoplex nanoparticles.

In vitro models are utilized to replicate the complex tumor microenvironment, explore the interactions between cells and their surrounding microenvironment, and assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for tumors. The replication of the latency period of bone metastasis through animal models has posed a challenge, primarily due to the requirement of primary tumor removal and the existence of numerous potential metastatic sites. Novel bone metastasis models, such as three-dimensional (3D) models, have been suggested as a potential solution to address the limitations associated with two-dimensional (2D) models and animal models. Notwithstanding, extant 3D models are constrained by factors such as irregular cellular proliferation, autofluorescence, and alterations in genetic and epigenetic expression.",

Biological Barriers for the Application of Gene Therapy\n\nDespite these recent breakthroughs, five important barriers continue to constrain progress (visualized in Figure 3 and described in Table 2):\n\nTransgene Size : The first restriction to the application of gene therapy is the size of the transgene, which needs to fit into the delivery vector. For recombinant AAV vectors, the DNA packaging size is limited to about 4.7 kb, hence requiring transgenes to be engineered accordingly [161,162]. If the vector genome exceeds the vector capacity, the transgene expression and protein folding might be adversely affected [152].\n\nVector Organotropism and Uptake : Second, vector delivery to the target cells, and vector uptake, intracellular transport, and uncoating remain a problem.",

Despite their early promise, the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s led to a decline in phage research and application in the Western world. However, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has rekindled interest in phage therapy as a viable alternative or complement to traditional antibiotics [3-5].

After its discovery, subsequent research studies provided the foundational knowledge that led to the use of AAV as a gene delivery vector.

Consequently, there is still a need to be selective in choosing pairs for experimental testing. That some paralog pairs are more likely to be synthetic lethal than others suggests that it may be possible to prioritise those gene pairs with the highest probability of being synthetic lethal for inclusion in screens. Recently, De Kegel et al. developed a machine learning approach to rank all paralog pairs according to their likelihood of being synthetic lethal, and demonstrated that this can be used to accurately predict the results of combinatorial CRISPR screens [14].",

Cancers can also occur with enhanced degradation of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) by Skp2 [86,87]. Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (Yap) promotes tumor growth and metastasis [88].

Tumors have a complex microenvironment, including dense extracellular matrix, stromal, immune, and irregular vascular infiltrate [47,48].

A previously conducted Phase 1 study showed poly-specific T-cell responses and delayed tumor recurrence up to three years post tumor resection [132]. The established process of tumor sample acquisition, and subsequent cell sequencing to identify suitable neo-epitopes, finally followed by mRNA design by integrating the most immunogenic neo-epitopes, allows a rapid and scalable production of personalized tumor vaccines [133]. Two major challenges of the mRNA-based cancer vaccine approach, however, are the accurate mapping of the cancer mutanome and the selection of neoantigens on a patient-specific basis [127].",

Recently, the American Cancer Society announced that the three-year survival rate for lung cancer from 2014 to 2021 was raised from 21% to almost 31% [4]. The efficacy of targeted therapies and immunotherapeutics has been investigated in a variety of solid tumors [5].

A key characteristic of cancer is the rapid production of abnormal cells that grow beyond their normal boundaries, potentially invading adjacent body parts and spreading to other organs. This spreading, known as metastasis, is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths [1]. Despite advances in early detection, surgical techniques, and targeted therapy, challenges in cancer treatment persist, including low efficacy, high toxicity, and drug resistance, severely impacting patients' quality of life. Consequently, the search for efficient, safe, and highly selective anti-cancer compounds has become a crucial aspect of contemporary cancer research [2].\n\nThe sea covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and is a land rich in resources.",

In the following, we will report an overview of the most relevant and frequently applied approaches.\n\n## 3.2.1. Spheroids\n\nIn spheroid studies, the applications of image-based techniques typically aim to monitor the temporal dynamics of the 3D morphology over several days in order to identify possible changes induced by the treatment. To this end, multiple morphological features, such as the volume, shape, perimeter, density and diameter, are tracked before, during and after drug exposure. Symmetrically to the in vivo settings, a reduction of spheroid volume is generally considered as the primary endpoint of treatment efficacy [64]. Therefore, tracking the temporal dynamic of spheroid volume is a crucial task.",
